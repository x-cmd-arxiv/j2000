The magnitude of this damping, evaluated by Bildsten and\nUshomirsky (BU) under the assumption of a perfectly rigid crust, sets the\nmaximum spin frequency for a neutron star spun up by accretion in a Low-Mass\nX-ray binary (LMXB). In this paper we explore the mechanical coupling between\nthe core r-modes and the elastic crust, using a toy model of a constant density\nneutron star with a constant shear modulus crust. We find that, at spin\nfrequencies in excess of ~50 Hz, the r-modes strongly penetrate the crust. This\nreduces the relative motion (slippage) between the crust and the core compared\nto the rigid crust limit. We therefore revise down, by as much as a factor of\n10^2-10^3, the damping rate computed by BU, significantly reducing the maximal\npossible spin frequency of neutron star with a solid crust. The dependence of\nthe crust-core slippage on the spin frequency is complicated, and is very\nsensitive to the physical thickness of the crust. If the crust is sufficiently\nthick, the curve of the critical spin frequency for the onset of the r-mode\ninstability becomes multi-valued for some temperatures; this is related to the\navoided crossings between the r-mode and the higher-order torsional modes in\nthe crust. The critical frequencies are comparable to the observed spins of\nneutron stars in LMXBs and millisecond pulsars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2000 22:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In the slow wind from a red supergiant star,\nthere is the possibility of gravitational accretion of wind matter onto the\ncircumstellar disk.

First, we study\nthe six cases m = 2, N = 2,...,7 by computing the the 3 x 3 Fisher information\nmatrices for the corresponding optimal measurements recently devised by Vidal\net al (quant-ph/9812068) for N = 2,...,7. We obtain simple polynomial\nexpressions for the (\"Gill-Massar\") traces of the products of the inverse of\nthe quantum Helstrom information matrix and these Fisher information matrices.\nThe six traces all have minima of 2 N -1 in the pure state limit, while for\nseparable measurements (quant-ph/9902063), the traces can equal N, but not\nexceed it. Then, the result of an analysis for m = 3, N = 2 leads us to\nconjecture that for optimal measurements for all m and N, the \"Gill-Massar\ntrace\" achieves a minimum of (2N-1)(m-1) in the pure state limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2000 21:48:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2000 19:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
