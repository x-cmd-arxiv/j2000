A dimensionless ``(inverse)\ncoupling'' constant is defined so that the value of the action of the model is\nfinite per lattice point. The path integral of the model is expanded in the\ncharacters and shown to be written as a sum over surface-like excitations in\nspacetime. A 3 dimensional version of the model exists and can be reduced to\nlattice BF theory. The expectation values of some quantities are computed in 3\ndimensions and the meanings of the results are discussed.
