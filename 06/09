The\nrotation axes of the disc material orbiting at large distances from the star\nand that of the star are supposed to coincide. The misalignment of the magnetic\nand rotation axes results in the magnetic pressure not being the same on the\nupper and lower surfaces of the disc. The resultant net vertical force produces\na warp which appears stationary in a frame corotating with the star. We find\nthat, if viscosity is large enough (alpha on the order of 0.01-0.1) to damp\nbending waves as they propagate away, a smoothly varying warp of the inner\nregion of the disc is produced. The amplitude of the warp can easily be on the\norder of ten percent of the disc inner radius for reasonably small misalignment\nangles (less than 30 degrees). Viscous damping also introduces a phase shift\nbetween the warp and the forcing torque, which results in the locations of\nmaximum elevation above the disc forming a trailing spiral pattern.

One promising candidate is probably the empirical\ndensity profile proposed by Burkert, which resembles an isothermal profile with\na constant core in the inner region and matches the NFW profile at large radii.\nMeanwhile, such a revised dark halo (RDH) profile has turned out a great\nsuccess on galactic scales. This stimulates us to apply the RDH profile to more\nmassive systems like clusters of galaxies. In this paper we have made an\nattempt to derive the radial density profile of intracluster gas from the RDH\nprofile, and compare it with those revealed by X-ray observations and inferred\nfrom the NFW profile. It is shown that the RDH predicted gas density can be\nwell represented by the conventional beta model with a typical beta parameter\nof 0.7-0.9.

Using the 45 clusters, we find that the central densities\nof clusters have an average value of ~0.01 solar mass pc^{-3}, in agreement\nwith the result estimated on galactic scales, which reinforces the claim for\nthe presence of the soft halo cores over the entire mass range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2000 07:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In the present\npaper, the stability region of all three phases has been established from high\nresolution synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction measurements on a series of\nhighly homogeneous samples with 0.42 <=x<= 0.52. At 20K the monoclinic phase is\nstable in the range 0.46 <=x<= 0.51, and this range narrows as the temperature\nis increased. A first-order phase transition from tetragonal to rhombohedral\nsymmetry is observed only for x= 0.45. The MPB, therefore, corresponds not to\nthe tetragonal-rhombohedral phase boundary, but instead to the boundary between\nthe tetragonal and monoclinic phases for 0.46 <=x<= 0.51. This result provides\nimportant insight into the close relationship between the monoclinic phase and\nthe striking piezoelectric properties of PZT; in particular, investigations of\npoled samples have shown that the monoclinic distortion is the origin of the\nunusually high piezoelectric response of PZT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2000 21:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}

Analytic expressions for the transverse momentum and light-cone\nmomentum distributions are derived to all orders in powers of the gluon opacity\nof the medium, $N\\sigma_g/A=L/\\lambda_g$. The reaction operator approach also\nleads to a simple algebraic proof of the ``color triviality'' of single\ninclusive distributions and to a solvable set of recursion relations. The\nanalytic solution generalizes previous continuum solutions (BDMPS) for\napplications to mesoscopic QCD plasmas. The solution is furthermore not\nrestricted to uncorrelated geometries and allows for evolving screening scales\nas well as the inclusion of finite kinematic constraints. The later is\nparticularly important because below LHC energies the kinematic constraints\nsignificantly decrease the non-abelian energy loss. Our solution for the\ninclusive distribution also generalizes the finite order exclusive (tagged)\ndistribution case studied previously (GLV1). The form of the analytic solution\nis well suited for numerical implementation in Monte Carlo event generators to\nenable more accurate calculations of jet quenching in ultra-relativistic\nnuclear collisions. Numerical results illustrating the constributions of the\nfirst three orders in opacity are compared to the ``self-quenching'' hard\nradiation intensity.

The advanced\nresearch course was open to graduate students, senior researchers, and\nmotivated under-graduate students with good background in physics and\nmathematics. The course covered several multi-disciplinary issues of modern\nresearch on astrophysical dynamics, and thus also of interest to physicists,\nmathematicians and engineers. The major topic was gas dynamics, viewed in\ncontext with stellar dynamics and plasma physics. The course was complemented\nby parallel seminars on hot topics given by experts in such fields, and open to\na wide scientific audience. In particular, I gave a friendly introduction to\nwavelets, which are becoming an increasingly powerful tool not only for\nprocessing signals and images but also for analysing fractals and turbulence,\nand which promise to have important applications to dynamical modelling of disc\ngalaxies. The workshop was open to a wide scientific audience.

The contributions\nwere refereed and their quality is high on average, exceptionally high in a few\ncases.
