It is\nsuggested that BR scaling gives the background around which the fluctuations\nare weak. A simple model with BR-scaled parameters is constructed and\nreproduces the properties of the nuclear ground state at normal nuclear matter\ndensity successfully. It shows that the tree level in the model Lagrangian is\nenough to describe the fluctuations around BR-scaled background. The model\nLagrangian is consistent thermodynamically and reproduces relativistic Landau\nFermi-liquid properties. Such points are important for dealing with hadronic\nmatter under extreme condition. On the other hand it is shown that the vector\ncurrent obtained from the chiral Lagrangian is the same as that obtained from\nLandau-Migdal approach. We can determine the Landau parameter in terms of\nBR-scaled parameter. However these two approaches provide different results,\nwhen applied to the axial charge. The numerical difference is small.
