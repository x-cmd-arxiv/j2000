The initial\ncloud is spherical while the magnetic field is uniform and transverse to the\ncloud motion. A simplified analytical model that describes the magnetic energy\nevolution in front of the cloud is developed and compared with simulation\nresults. In addition, it is found the interaction of the cloud with a\nmagnetized interstellar medium (ISM) results in the formation of a highly\nstructured magnetotail. The magnetic flux in the wake of the cloud organizes\ninto flux ropes and a reconnection, current sheet is developed, as field lines\nof opposite polarity are brought close together near the symmetry axis. At the\nsame time, magnetic pressure is strongly enhanced at the leading edge of the\ncloud from the stretching of the field lines that occurs there. This has an\nimportant dynamical effect on the subsequent evolution of the cloud, since some\nunstable modes tend to be strongly enhanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2000 19:26:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The additional term\nhighlights a complementarity between mean field magnetic dynamo theory and\naccretion disc theory treated as a mean field theory. Such pseudoscalar terms\nhave been studied, and can lead to large scale magnetic field and vorticity\ngrowth. Here it is shown that vorticity can grow even in the simplest azimuthal\nand half-height integrated disc model, for which mean quantities depend only on\nradius. The simplest vorticity growth solutions seem to have scales and vortex\nsurvival times consistent those required for facilitating planet formation.\nAlso it is shown that when the magnetic back-reaction is included to lowest\norder, the pseudoscalar driving the magnetic field growth and that driving the\nvorticity growth will behave differently with respect to shearing and\nnon-shearing flows: the former can reverse sign in the two cases, while the\nlatter will have the same sign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2000 07:54:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2000 06:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
