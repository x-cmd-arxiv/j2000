These results are interpreted as support\nfor an age, but not metallicity, related origin of the diversity in SNe Ia. If\nconfirmed with a larger and more accurate sample of data, the age-luminosity\nrelation would offer a new and powerful tool to probe the ages and age\ngradients of stellar populations in galaxies at redshift as high as $z\\sim1-2$.\nThe absence of significant radial gradients in the peak $\\rm (B-V)_0$ and $\\rm\n(V-I)_0$ colors of SNe Ia supports the redding correction method of Phillips et\nal (1999).

If the magnetic field of 40 Eridani B is\na central dipole, then the rotational axis inclination to the line of sight is\ni ~ 90 DEG, and the magnetic axis inclination to the rotational axis is about\nthe same, beta ~ 90 DEG.

Results of PDS analysis of\nobserved GRBs suggest that the averaged PDS of GRBs follows a power law over\nabout two decades of frequency with the power law index, -5/3, and the\ndistribution of individual power follows an exponential distribution. Though an\nattempt to identify the most sensitive physical parameter has been made on the\nbasis of the internal shock model, we demonstrate that conclusions of this kind\nof approach should be derived with due care. It is indicative that the physical\ninformation extracted from the slope can be misleading. We show that the\nreported slope and the distribution can be reproduced by adjusting the sampling\ninterval in the time domain for a given decaying timescale of individual pulse\nin a specific form of GRB light curves. In particular, given that the temporal\nfeature is modeled by a two-sided exponential function, the power law behavior\nwith the index of -5/3 and the exponential distribution of the observed PDS is\nrecovered at the 64 ms trigger time scale when the decaying timescale of\nindividual pulse is $\\sim 1$ second, provided that the pulse sharply rises.\nAnother way of using the PDS analysis is an application of the same method to\nindividual long bursts in order to examine a possible evolution of the decaying\ntimescale in a single burst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Jun 2000 13:01:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2001 04:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Here we analyze the trapping dynamics in these settings, focusing on\ntwo points of interest. Firstly, we investigate the extent to which\nlight-induced forces in these experiments are distinct from their free-space\ncounterparts. Secondly, we explore the quantitative features of the resulting\natomic motion and how these dynamics are mapped onto variations of the\nintracavity field. Not surprisingly, qualitatively distinct atomic dynamics\narise as the coupling and dissipative rates are varied. For the experiment of\nHood et al., we show that atomic motion is largely conservative and is\npredominantly in radial orbits transverse to the cavity axis. A comparison with\nthe free-space theory demonstrates that the fluctuations of the dipole force\nare suppressed by an order of magnitude. This effect is based upon the\nJaynes-Cummings eigenstates of the atom-cavity system and represents\nqualitatively new physics for optical forces at the single-photon level. By\ncontrast, even in a regime of strong coupling in the experiment of Pinkse et\nal., there are only small quantitative distinctions between the free-space\ntheory and the quantum theory, so it is not clear that description of this\nexperiment as a novel single-quantum trapping effect is necessary. The atomic\nmotion is strongly diffusive, leading to an average localization time\ncomparable to the time for an atom to transit freely through the cavity and to\na reduction in the ability to infer aspects of the atomic motion from the\nintracavity photon number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Jun 2000 22:50:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2000 17:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2000 23:01:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2000 06:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
