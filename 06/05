The spectrum obtained with an aperture covering the\nfull galaxy shows no absorption lines of diffuse H2 at the radial velocity of\nthe galaxy. The upper limit for the diffuse H2 column density is found to be\nvery low: N(H2) <~ 10^15 cm-2 (10 sigma), unlike our Galaxy where H2 is\ngenerally present for even low HI column densities. Although the HI column\ndensity is here as high as N(HI) ~ 2.10^21 cm-2, we observe 2N(H2)/N(HI)<<\n10^-6. We cannot exclude the possibility that some H2 could be in very dense,\nsmall and discrete clumps which cannot be detected with the present\nobservation. However, the remarkable absence of diffuse H2 in this metal-poor\ngalaxy can be explained by the low abundance of dust grains (needed to form\nthis molecule from H-atoms), the high ultraviolet flux and the low density of\nthe HI cloud surrounding the star-forming regions. Thus having eliminated\ndiffuse H2 as a significant contributor to the total mass, it appears that the\ngas of the galaxy is dominated by HI, and that the high dynamical mass is not\ncomposed of cold and diffuse baryonic dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2000 15:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We first present a slightly easier version\nusing complex analysis, which allows us to construct the uniformizing maps more\nor less explicitly in terms of the initial coordinates given. Then we give the\nmore general and coordinate invariant version, which we prove by extending\nKodaira's theory of the Jacobian fibration to a family of singular curves\nconstructed via algebraic geometry.\n  Finally, using the results obtained with the Jacobian fibration, we obtain\ntwo equivalent conditions for an complex surface nonhyperbolically fibered over\na complex curve to be holomorphically dominable by $\\CC^2$.

The\ndescription of reproductive isolation used is based on the classical Dobzhansky\nmodel and its recently proposed multilocus generalizations. The dynamics of\nparapatric speciation is modeled as a biased random walk with absorption\nperformed by the average genetic distance between the residents and immigrants.\nIf a small number of genetic changes is sufficient for complete reproductive\nisolation, mutation and random genetic drift alone can cause speciation on the\ntime scale of 10-1000 times the inverse of the mutation rate. Even relatively\nweak selection for local adaptation can dramatically decrease the waiting time\nto speciation. The duration of parapatric speciation is shorter by orders of\nmagnitude than the waiting time to speciation. For a wide range of parameter\nvalues, the duration of speciation is order one over the mutation rate.
