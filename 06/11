A simple model of the emission, combined with our\nknowledge of the inner jet, suggests that the energy input into this region\nfrom the M87 nucleus exceeds the energy being radiated away as X-rays. This\nargues that the region within 40 kpc of the center of M87 is currently\ndominated by energy input from the M87 nucleus.

If G is the group of all orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of\nthe circle S^1, then M_G can be identified with S^1 (V. Pestov). We show that\nthe circle cannot be replaced by the Hilbert cube or a compact manifold of\ndimension >1. This answers a question of V. Pestov. Moreover, we prove that for\nevery topological group G the action of G on M_G is not 3-transitive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2000 23:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

We focus on a case of relatively large metastability and low viscosity,\nwhen it can be shown analytically that no steadily moving phase-transition\nfront exists. Numerically simulating a system of the one-dimensional\nNavier-Stokes and continuity equations, we find that, in this case, the\nnonsteady phase-transition front emits acoustic shocks in forward and backward\ndirections. Through this mechanism, the front drops its velocity and eventually\ncomes to a halt. The acoustic shock wave may shuttle, bouncing elastically from\nthe system's edge and strongly inelastically from the phase transition front.\nNonsteady rarefaction shock waves appear in the shuttle process, despite the\nfact that the model does not admit steady rarefaction waves propagating between\nstationary states. If the viscosity is below a certain threshold, an\ninstability sets in, driving the system into a turbulent state.
