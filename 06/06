In this paper, we scrutinize the observational evidence for the\nincongruity between dwarf galaxies and the CDM model. To this end, we analyze\nthe rotation curves of 20 late-type dwarf galaxies studied by Swaters (1999).\nTaking the effects of beam-smearing and adiabatic contraction into account, we\nfit mass models to these rotation curves with dark matter halos with different\ncusp slopes, ranging from constant density cores to r^{-2} cusps. Uncertainties\nin the stellar mass-to-light ratio and the limited spatial sampling of the\nhalo's density distribution hamper a unique mass decomposition. Consequently,\nthe rotation curves in our sample cannot be used to discriminate between dark\nhalos with constant density cores and r^{-1} cusps. We show that the dwarf\ngalaxies analyzed here are consistent with cold dark matter halos in a LCDM\ncosmology, and that there is thus no need to abandon the idea that dark matter\nis cold and collisionless. However, the data is also consistent with any\nalternative dark matter model that produces dark matter halos with central\ncusps less steep than r^{-1.5}. In fact, we argue that based on existing\nrotation curves alone at best weak limits can be obtained on cosmological\nparameters and/or the nature of the dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2000 23:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2001 10:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The distribution of the path centroid bar{P}=(1/L)\nsum_{i=1}^{L}P(n_i) tends to the Wigner function W(x), the joint distribution\nfor the operators: W(x)=lim_{L->infinity} <delta(x-bar{P})>_{L}. This result is\nproved in the case where the Hamiltonian commutes with hat{x}. The Wigner\nfunction is non-positive if the dominant paths with path centroid in a certain\nregion have Berry phases close to odd multiples of pi. For finite L the path\ncentroid distribution is a Wigner function convolved with a Gaussian of\nvariance inversely proportional to L. The results are illustrated by numerical\ncalculations of the spin Wigner function from SU(2) coherent states. The\nrelevance to the quantum Monte Carlo sign problem is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2000 16:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
