As a consequence of the gauge-anomaly cancellation and the index\ntheorem for flavor-singlet anomalies, the net number of zero-modes pushed down\ninto and pumped out from the zero-energy level by the gauge field is zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2000 14:45:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Radio frequency\npulses are used in coherent spectroscopy to implement a unitary transfer of\nstate. Pulse sequences that accomplish a desired transfer should be as short as\npossible in order to minimize the effects of relaxation and to optimize the\nsensitivity of the experiments. Here, we give an analytical characterization of\nsuch time optimal pulse sequences applicable to coherence transfer experiments\nin multiple-spin systems. We have adopted a general mathematical formulation,\nand present many of our results in this setting, mindful of the fact that new\nstructures in optimal pulse design are constantly arising. Moreover, the\ngeneral proofs are no more difficult than the specific problems of current\ninterest. From a general control theory perspective, the problems we want to\nstudy have the following character. Suppose we are given a controllable right\ninvariant system on a compact Lie group, what is the minimum time required to\nsteer the system from some initial point to a specified final point? In NMR\nspectroscopy and quantum computing, this translates to, what is the minimum\ntime required to produce a unitary propagator? We also give an analytical\ncharacterization of maximum achievable transfer in a given time for the two\nspin system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jun 2000 20:10:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2000 14:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
