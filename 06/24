Daily integrations show strong spectral\nchanges during the observation. Ourmain result is that we find the X-ray\nspectral index to be correlated with the UV flux. Furthermore, the broad-band\nX-ray photon flux is also correlated with the UV continuum. These correlations\npoint towards a model in which the X-rays originate via thermal Comptonization\nof UV seed photons. Furthermore, the UV is also correlated with the\nextrapolation of the X-ray power law into the soft X-ray/EUV region. Our data\nanalysis therefore re-opens the possibility the the UV photons and their\nvariability arise from reprocessing, as long as the primary source of heating\nis photo-electric absorption in the reprocessor, rather than Compton\ndownscattering, A coherent picture of the X-ray/UV variability can therefore be\nconstructed whereby absorption and reprocessing of EUV/soft X-rays in a\nstandard accretion disk produce a variable seed photon distribution which are\nin turn up-scattered into the X-ray band. We also find a significant\ncorrelation between the 2-10 keV flux and the 6.4 keV iron K-line suggesting\nthat at least some portion of the line originates within ~1 lt day of the X-ray\ncontinuum source. Neither the power law photon index nor the Compton reflection\ncomponent are correlated with the 2-10 keV flux. The latter is not correlated\nwith the iron K line flux either. We do find an apparent correlation between\nthe X-ray spectral index and the strength of the Compton reflection component.\nIn an Appendix we show, however, that this can be produced by a combination of\nstatistical and systematic errors. We conclude the apparent variations in the\nCompton reflection component may be an artifact of these effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2000 17:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
