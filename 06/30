Originally this selection was\naimed at selecting old (> 1 Gyr) passively evolving elliptical galaxies at\nintermediate redshift (1<z<2), but it was soon discovered that young\nstar-forming dusty galaxies can show similar colours and therefore be selected\nin the same surveys. It is crucial to distinguish between these two populations\nbecause they have very different consequences on the models of galaxy\nformation. Here we show that old ellipticals and dusty starburst are expected\nto show different colours in the (I-K) vs. (J-K) diagram for redshift range\n1<z<2, providing thus a useful tool to classify ERGs in large samples up to\nK<20. This is mainly due to the fact that old galaxies at these redshifts have\na strong 4000 ang. break at lambda<1.2 mic. (J band), while dusty galaxies show\na smoother spectral energy distributions and therefore redder J-K colours. We\ndiscuss this difference in detail both in the framework of the stellar\npopulation synthesis models and by using observed spectra. The selection\ncriterion is also compared with the properties of ERGs of known nature. We also\nshow that this colour selection criterion is also useful to separate the ERGs\nfrom brown dwarf stars showing similar optical-to-IR colours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2000 16:24:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2000 13:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2000 06:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Our simulations offer a 3-D physical model\nof the `kuiperoidal' dust cloud based on the distribution of 280 dust particle\ntrajectories produced by 100 known Kuiper belt objects ; the resulting 3-D grid\nconsists of $1.9\\times 10^6$ cells containing $1.2\\times 10^{11}$ particle\npositions. The following processes that influence the dust particle dynamics\nare taken into account: 1) gravitational scattering on the eight planets\n(neglecting Pluto); 2) planetary resonances; 3) radiation pressure; and 4) the\nPoynting-Robertson (P-R) and solar wind drags. We find the dust distribution\nhighly non-uniform: there is a minimum in the kuiperoidal dust between Mars and\nJupiter, after which both the column and number densities of kuiperoidal dust\nsharply increase with heliocentric distance between 5 and 10 AU, and then form\na plateau between 10 and 50 AU. Between 25 and 45 AU, there is an appreciable\nconcentration of kuiperoidal dust in the form of a broad belt of mostly\nresonant particles associated with Neptune.

As with the cometary belts simulated in\nour related papers (Ozernoy, Gorkavyi, & Taidakova 2000a,b), we reveal a\ncomplex resonant structure of the dust belts containing rich families of\nresonant peaks and gaps.
