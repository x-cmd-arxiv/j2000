Applications to problems in electrostatics are discussed, in\nparticular numerical solutions of Poisson and Poisson-Boltzmann equations.\nNext, methods for solving self-consistent eigenvalue problems in real space are\npresented; these techniques have been extensively applied to solutions of the\nHartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham equations of electronic structure, and to eigenvalue\nproblems arising in semiconductor and polymer physics. Finally, real-space\nmethods have found recent application in computations of optical response and\nexcited states in time-dependent density functional theory, and these\ncomputational developments are summarized.

First order and\nsecond order correlation functions of the atomic field are used to characterize\nthe coherence properties of the gas along the axis of the guide. The coherence\nlength of the gas is found to be much larger than the thermal de Broglie\nwavelength in the strongly quantum degenerate regime. Large intensity\nfluctuations present in the ideal Bose gas model are found to be strongly\nreduced by repulsive atomic interactions; this conclusion is obtained with a\none-dimensional classical field approximation valid when the temperature of the\ngas is much higher than its chemical potential, k_B T >> |mu|.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2000 10:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
