We demonstrate that the\nfinally observed elliptic flow is established earlier in the collision than the\nobserved radial flow and thus probes the equation of state at higher energy\ndensities. We point out that a phase transition from hadronic matter to a\ncolor-deconfined quark-gluon plasma leads to non-monotonic behaviour in both\nbeam energy and impact parameter dependences which, if observed, can be used to\nidentify such a phase transition.
