These defining\nquantum numbers of the Higgs remain unconstrained while the whole basic and\nfundamental structure of the Standard Model remains intact. Hence it is shown\nthat the Higgs cannot be a physical particle. Higgs is the underlying `vacuum'\nover which the whole edifice of the Standard Model stands. Also on most general\ngrounds it is established here that as per the Standard Model there is no\nelectric charge above the electro-weak phase transition temperature. Hence\nthere was no electric charge present in the Early Universe. The Superstring\nTheories are flawed in as much as they are incompatible with this requirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2000 06:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}
