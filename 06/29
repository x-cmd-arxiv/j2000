UGC7321 is a\nlow-luminosity spiral (M_B,i=-17.0) with a diffuse, low surface brightness\nstellar disk and no discernible bulge component. Within 0.25' (725 pc) of the\ndisk center the global luminosity profile of UGC7321 can be reasonably\ncharacterized by an exponential function with a scale height h_z=2.9\" (140 pc)\nin H and h_z=3.1\" (150 pc) in R, making this among the thinnest galaxy disks\nknow.

At intermediate galactocentric radii (0.25'<r<1.5'), the disk of\nUGC7321 becomes less peaked than an exponential near the galactic plane.

The\nX-ray source exhibits a number of flares with factors of 3-4 flux changes\nduring a half day ASCA observation. Such X-ray variability is in constrast to\nthe behaviour of other low luminosity active galaxies. It provides further\nsupport for an accreting black hole model rather than an extreme stellar\nprocess in accounting for the nuclear activity of NGC4395. The soft X-ray\nemission below 3 keV is strongly attenuated by absorption. The energy spectrum\nin this absorption band shows a dramatic change in response to the variation in\ncontinuum luminosity. A variable warm absorber appears to be an explanation for\nthe spectral change. The absorption-corrected 2-10 keV luminosity is 4e39 erg/s\nfor a source distance of 2.6 Mpc, and at 1 keV is one order of magnitude above\nprevious ROSAT estimates. Our X-ray results infer the nuclear source of NGC4395\nto be a scaled-down version of higher luminosity Seyfert nuclei, with an\nintermediate mass (10^4-10^5 Msun) black hole, unlike the nearby low luminosity\nactive galaxies in which underfed massive black holes are suspected to reside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2000 13:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}

In addition to various dusty plasma\nphenomena, several specific colloidal effects should be considered. We focus on\nradiometric forces, which are caused by inhomogeneous temperature distribution.\nAside from thermophoresis, the role of temperature distribution in dusty\nplasmas is an open question. It is shown that inhomogeneous heating of the\ngrain by ion flows results in a new photophoresis like force, which is specific\nfor dusty discharges. This radiometric force can be observable under conditions\nof recent microgravity experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2000 09:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Requiring a finite dimensional version\nof the Wigner function to be well defined we find a natural time quantization\nthat leads to classical maps from which the arithmetical basis of quantum\nrevivals is seen. The flux line, that fundamentally alters the quantum\nstatistics, forces this time quantum to be increased by a factor of a winding\nnumber and determines the homotopy class of the path. The value of the flux is\nrestricted to the rational numbers, a feature that persists in the infinite\ndimensional limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2000 10:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

A major benefit of such a characterisation is\nthat it directly leads to a numerical procedure for calculating EoF. We present\nan efficient minimisation algorithm and an apply it to the bound entangled 3X3\nHorodecki states; we show that their EoF is very low and that their distance to\nthe set of separable states is also very low.

The well-known physical interpretations associated with the\nrelativistic Dirac equation involving the symmetry operations of time-reversal\nT, charge conjugation C, parity P, and their products are reinterpreted here by\nexamining their action on the basic Bell states. The transformation properties\nof the Bell basis states under these symmetry operations also reveal that C is\nthe only operator that does not mix the Bell states whereas all others do. In a\nsimilar fashion, expressing the various logic gates introduced in the subject\nof quantum computers in terms of the Dirac matrices shows for example, that the\nNOT gate is related to the product of time-reversal and parity operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2000 15:59:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
