A fraction of the emitted spectrum is possibly\nabsorbed in interactions with low energy photons of the diffuse extragalactic\ninfrared radiation, which in turn offers the unique possibility to measure the\ndiffuse infrared radiation density by TeV spectroscopy. The upper limit on the\ndensity of the extragalactic infrared radiation derived from the TeV\nobservations imposes constraints on models of galaxy formation and stellar\nevolution. One of the recently published ideas to overcome severe absorption of\nTeV photons is based upon the assumption that sources like Mrk 501 could\nproduce Bose-Einstein condensates of coherent photons. The condensates would\nhave a higher survival probability during the transport in the diffuse\nradiation field and could mimic TeV air shower events.

It is shown that in general the universal multicritical\nproperties of unidirectionally coupled directed percolation processes with\nlinear coupling can also be described by the model. Consequently the crossover\nexponent describing the scaling of the linear coupling parameters is given by\n$\\Phi =1$ to all orders of the perturbation expansion. As an example of\nunidirectionally coupled directed percolation, we discuss the population\ndynamics of the tournaments of three colors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2000 12:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For most field theories, the Lipatov\nasymptotics has the functional form c a^N \\Gamma(N+b) (N is the order of\nperturbation theory), and the relative corrections to it have a form of a\nseries in powers of 1/N. It is shown that this series diverges factorially and\nits high-order coefficients can be calculated using a procedure similar to\nLipatov's one. The K-th expansion coefficient has the form\nconst(\\ln(S1/S0))^{-K}\\Gamma(K+(r1-r0)/2), where S0 and S1 are the values of\nthe action for the first and the second instanton of the field theory under\nconsideration, while r0 and r1 are the corresponding numbers of zero modes. The\ninstantons satisfy the same equation as in the Lipatov method and are assumed\nto be renumbered in order of increasing of their action. This result has the\nuniversal character and is valid in any field theory for which the Lipatov\nasymptotic form is as specified above.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2000 11:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
