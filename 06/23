At small scales, clustering\nstatistics are dominated by halo density profiles, whereas at large scales,\ncorrelations are the result of combining non-linear perturbation theory with\nhalo biasing. Galaxies are assumed to follow the dark matter profiles, and\ngalaxy formation efficiency is given by the number of galaxies as a function of\nhalo mass. This approach leads to generic predictions: the galaxy power\nspectrum shows a power-law behavior even though the dark matter does not, and\nthe galaxy higher-order correlations show smaller amplitudes at small scales\nthan their dark matter counterparts, as observed in galaxy catalogs. We find\nthat requiring to fit both the second and third order moments of the APM\ngalaxies provides a strong constraint on galaxy formation models. The data at\nlarge scales require that galaxy formation be relatively efficient at small\nmasses, m =10^10 Msun/h, whereas data at smaller scales require that the number\nof galaxies in a halo scale as the mass to the 0.8th power in the high-mass\nlimit. These constraints are independent of those derived from the luminosity\nfunction or Tully-Fisher relation. We also predict the power spectrum,\nbispectrum, and higher-order moments of the mass density field. Although halo\nmodels agree well with measurements of the mass power spectrum and the higher\norder Sp parameters in N-body simulations, the model assumption that halos are\nspherical leads to disagreement in the configuration dependence of the\nbispectrum at small scales. We stress the importance of finite volume effects\nin higher-order statistics and show how they can be estimated in this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2000 21:22:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2000 17:42:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Observations of the properties of dust in very young galaxies\nwill be an important probe of the rates of star formation in terms of the\nproduction and destruction of dust grains. Future observations of dust at high\nspectral and spatial resolution will provide detailed information on processes\nin collapsing clouds up to star formation. Space missions to comets in the next\ncentury will first study them in situ but ultimately will bring back pristine\nnucleus material which will contain the end product of the collapsing\nprotosolar molecular cloud at the time of planet formation. If one of the\ncurrent theories of the origin of life from comets is correct, laboratory\nstudies of comet dust grains immersed in water may give direct indications of\nprebiotic chemical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2000 13:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

At large\nseparations, the sequences of quasi-circular orbits match well with\npost-Newtonian expansions, although a clear signature of the simplifying\nassumption of conformal flatness is seen. The position of the ISCO is found to\nbe strongly dependent on the magnitude of the spin on each black hole. At close\nseparations of the holes, the effective potential method breaks down. In all\ncases where an ISCO could be determined, we found that an apparent horizon\nencompassing both holes forms for separations well inside the ISCO.\nNevertheless, we argue that the formation of a common horizon is still\nassociated with the breakdown of the effective potential method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2000 19:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We show that in the so\ncalled turbulent regime various periodic cluster attractor states are formed\neven though the coupling between the maps are very small relative to the\nnon-linearity in the element maps.\n  Most outstanding is a maximally symmetric three cluster attractor in period\nthree motion (MSCA) due to the foliation of the period three window of the\nelement logistic maps. An analytic approach is proposed which explains\nsuccessfully the systematics of various periodicity manifestations in the\nturbulent regime. The linear stability of the period three cluster attractors\nis investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2000 09:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
