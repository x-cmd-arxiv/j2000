We\nimprove previous estimates of this damping rate by including the effect of the\nCoriolis force on the boundary-layer eigenfunction and by using more realistic\nneutron-star models. If the crust is assumed to be perfectly rigid, the\ngravitational radiation driven instability in the r-modes is completely\nsuppressed in neutron stars colder than about 1.5 x 10^8 K. Energy generation\nin the boundary layer will heat the star, and will even melt the crust if the\namplitude of the r-mode is large enough. We solve the heat equation explicitly\n(including the effects of thermal conduction and neutrino emission) and find\nthat the r-mode amplitude needed to melt the crust is approximately a_c = 5 x\n10^{-3} for maximally rotating neutron stars. If the r-mode saturates at an\namplitude larger than a_c, the heat generated is sufficient to maintain the\nouter layers of the star in a mixed fluid-solid state analogous to the pack ice\non the fringes of the Arctic Ocean. We argue that in young, rapidly rotating\nneutron stars this effect considerably delays the formation of the crust. By\nconsidering the dissipation in the ice flow, we show that the final spin\nfrequency of stars with r-mode amplitude of order unity is close to the value\nestimated for fluid stars without a crust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2000 16:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The occurrence of\nsuch zeroes is related to the parity of the isolated dot levels. A statistical\nanalysis of the isolated dot wave-functions reveals the absence of significant\ncorrelations in the parity for large disorder and the appearance, for weak\ndisorder, of certain dot states which are strongly coupled to the leads. It is\nshown that large differences in the coupling to the leads give rise to an\nanomalous charging of the dot levels. A mechanism for the phase lapse observed\nexperimentally based on this property is discussed and illustrated with model\ncalculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2000 12:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Roughly speaking, it means that the field energy is localized but on\nclosed 2p-dimensional surfaces (quasi-localized). From the mathematical point\nof view this approach is implied by the boundary value problem for the\ncorresponding field equations. Various boundary problems, e.g. Dirichlet or\nNeumann, lead to different Hamiltonian dynamics. Physics seems to prefer\ngauge-invariant, positively defined Hamiltonians which turn out to be\nquasi-local. Our approach is closely related with the standard two-potential\nformulation and enables one to generate e.g. duality transformations in a\nperfectly local way (but with respect to a new set of nonlocal variables).\nMoreover, the form of the quantization condition displays very similar\nstructure to that of the symplectic form of the underlying p-form theory\nexpressed in the quasi-local language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2000 08:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2000 09:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
