R-modes involve primarily transverse,\nincompressive motions of the star's fluid core. However, neutron stars gain\ncrusts early in their lives: therefore, r-modes also imply shear in the fluid\nbeneath the crust. We examine the criterion for this shear layer to become\nturbulent, and derive the rate of dissipation in the turbulent regime. Unlike\ndissipation from a viscous boundary layer, turbulent energy loss is nonlinear\nin mode energy and can therefore cause the mode to saturate at amplitudes\ntypically much less than unity. This energy loss also reappears as heat below\nthe crust. We study the possibility of crust melting as well as its\nimplications for the spin evolution of low-mass X-ray binaries. Lastly, we\nidentify some universal features of the spin evolution that may have\nobservational consequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2000 22:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The morphology some 250 pc from the\nnucleus strongly suggests that the high-excitation gas is concentrated on the\nsurface of a hollow cone with apex close to the nucleus. Such a structure may\nresult through entrainment of dense gas from a circumnuclear torus in the\ngalaxy disk by a low density, outflowing wind or jet. Within 40 pc of the\nnucleus, the high-excitation gas takes the form of a striking, filled V-shaped\nstructure extending in the same direction as the larger scale high-excitation\nemission.

This co-operative delocalization--confinement lowers the\nenergy of the one-photon state and raises the relative energy of the lowest\ntwo-photon state. The two-photon state is slightly below the optical state in\nmono-phenyl substituted polyacetylenes, but above the optical state in\ndi-phenyl substituted polyacetylenes, thereby explaining the strong\nphotoluminescence of the latter class of materials.
