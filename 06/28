The observed line profile is\nrichly informative. We show that a sufficiently accurate, high spectral\nresolution ($R\\approx 10^4$) measurement of the line profile of a bright quasar\nis feasible using the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) as well as large\nground-based telescopes. Such a measurement has two potentially important\napplications. First, the red side of the Lyman alpha emission line provides a\nway to measure the quasar lifetime. Second, the blue side provides a direct\nmeasure of the density fluctuations of the intergalactic medium at the quasar\nredshift. The estimate of the absorption of the red side is limited by the\naccuracy to which the intrinsic profile of the Lyman alpha emission line is\nknown. The blue side, however, does not sensitively depend on the intrinsic\nprofile, because the former is much narrower than the latter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2000 19:41:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2000 06:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The structure of the holomorphic coupling is also\nfound from arguments of unification and anomaly cancellation under the\nconjectured $SL(2,Z)_{T_i}$ symmetries of the models. A consequence of the\nlatter is that in the case of the $Z_3$ orientifold the holomorphic coupling\nnecessarily contains a part with coefficient proportional to the one loop beta\nfunction, in agreement with string calculations which do not however assume\nthis symmetry. This gives circumstantial evidence for the existence of this\nsymmetry at string level in $Z_3$ orientifold. Finally, we comment on the\nvalues of the unification scale and examine the possibility of mirage\nunification in which the effective unification scale may be situated far above\nthe string scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2000 13:40:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2000 14:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2000 13:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

This method has the following two\nproperties. First, even if an eavesdropper (Eve) steals qubits, she can extract\ninformation from them with certain probability at most. Second, Alice and Bob\ncan confirm that the qubits are transmitted between them correctly by measuring\na signature. If Eve measures m qubits one by one from n enciphered qubits and\nsends alternative ones (the Intercept/Resend attack), a probability that Alice\nand Bob do not notice Eve's action is equal to (3/4)^m or less. Passwords for\ndecryption and the signature are given by classical binary strings and they are\ndisclosed through a public channel. Enciphering classical information by this\nmethod is equivalent to the one-time pad method with distributing a classical\nkey (random binary string) by the BB84 protocol. If Eve takes away qubits,\nAlice and Bob lose the original quantum information. If we apply our method to\na state in iteration, Eve's success probability decreases exponentially. We\ncannot examine security against the case that Eve makes an attack with using\nentanglement. This remains to be solved in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2000 00:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2000 03:06:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2000 19:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
