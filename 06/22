The pancake remains essentially undisturbed, even if the\nexplosion is strong enough to blow away all the gas located inside the halo at\nthe onset of the explosion and reheat the IGM surrounding the pancake. Infall\nquickly replenishes this ejected gas and gradually restores the gas fraction as\nthe halo mass continues to grow. Estimates of the collapse epoch and SN\nenergy-release for galaxies of different mass in the CDM model can relate these\nresults to scale-dependent questions of blow-out and blow-away and their\nimplication for early IGM heating and metal enrichment and the creation of\ndark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2000 16:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
