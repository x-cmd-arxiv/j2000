We identify two dominant effects, according to the typical spatial\ndimensions of the domains. Small antimatter domains are dissipated via neutron\ndiffusion prior to He4 synthesis at T_He4 \\approx 80 keV, leading to a\nsuppression of the primordial He4 mass fraction. Larger domains are dissipated\nbelow T_He4 via a combination of proton diffusion and hydrodynamic expansion.\nIn this case the strongest effects on the elemental abundances are due to\nanti-p He4 annihilations, leading to an overproduction of He3 relative to H2\nand to overproduction of Li6 via non-thermal nuclear reactions. Both effects\nmay result in light element abundances deviating substantially from the\nstandard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis yields and from the observationally inferred\nvalues. This allows us to derive stringent constraints on the antimatter\nparameters.

The\ntargeted cores are believed to be pre-stellar in nature and to represent the\ninitial conditions of low-mass, isolated star formation. In previous\nsubmillimeter dust continuum studies of such pre-stellar cores, it was found\nthat the derived column density profiles did not follow a single power-law such\nas N[H2] \\propto r^(-1) throughout their full extent but flattened out near\ntheir center. These submillimeter observations however could not constrain the\ndensity profiles at radii greater than ~ 10000 AU. The present absorption study\nuses ISOCAM's sensitivity to map these pre-stellar cores in absorption against\nthe diffuse mid-infrared background. The goal was to determine their structure\nat radii that extend beyond the limits of sensitivity of the submillimeter\ncontinuum maps and at twiceas good an angular resolution. Among the 24 cores\nobserved in our survey, a majority of them show deep absorption features. The\nstarless cores studied here all show a column density profile that flattens in\nthe center, which confirms the submillimeter emission results. Moreover, beyond\na radius of ~ 5000-10000 AU, the typical column density profile steepens with\ndistance from core center and gets steeper than N[H2] \\propto r^(-1), until it\neventually merges with the low-density ambient molecular cloud. At least three\nof the cores present sharp edges at R ~ 15000-30000 AU and appear to be\ndecoupled from their parent clouds, providing finite reservoirs of mass for\nsubsequent star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2000 14:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

Speech segmentation is challenging, since the cues typically\npresent for segmenting text (headers, paragraphs, punctuation) are absent in\nspoken language. We investigate the use of prosody (information gleaned from\nthe timing and melody of speech) for these tasks. Using decision tree and\nhidden Markov modeling techniques, we combine prosodic cues with word-based\napproaches, and evaluate performance on two speech corpora, Broadcast News and\nSwitchboard. Results show that the prosodic model alone performs on par with,\nor better than, word-based statistical language models -- for both true and\nautomatically recognized words in news speech. The prosodic model achieves\ncomparable performance with significantly less training data, and requires no\nhand-labeling of prosodic events. Across tasks and corpora, we obtain a\nsignificant improvement over word-only models using a probabilistic combination\nof prosodic and lexical information. Inspection reveals that the prosodic\nmodels capture language-independent boundary indicators described in the\nliterature. Finally, cue usage is task and corpus dependent. For example, pause\nand pitch features are highly informative for segmenting news speech, whereas\npause, duration and word-based cues dominate for natural conversation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2000 04:39:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-28"}

The actual form of\nthe signal is impossible to determine analytically, which lead to use of\nnumerical methods.\n  Two major approaches emerged. The first one formulates the gravitational\nradiation problem as a standard Cauchy initial value problem, while the other\napproach uses a Characteristic Initial value formulation. In the strong field\nregion, where caustics in the wavefronts are likely to form, the Cauchy\nformulation is more advantageous. On the other side, the Characteristic\nformulation is uniquely suited to study radiation problems because it describes\nspace-time in terms of radiation wavefronts.\n  The fact that the advantages and disadvantages of these two systems are\ncomplementary suggests that one may want to use the two of them together. In a\nfull nonlinear problem it would be advantageous to evolve the inner (strong\nfield) region using Cauchy evolution and the outer (radiation) region with the\nCharacteristic approach. Cauchy Characteristic Matching enables one to evolve\nthe whole space-time matching the boundaries of Cauchy and Characteristic\nevolution.

We consider a pitch angle\ndiffusion mechanism that is shown to scale with whistler wave amplitude and\nhence is 'switched on' during these periods of intense activity.\n  We consider the interaction between relativistic electrons and two oppositely\ndirected, parallel propagating whistler mode waves. We show that for intense\nwhistlers this process is stochastic and results in strong electron pitch angle\ndiffusion.\n  We show that the interaction is rapid, occur on timescales of the order of\ntens of electron gyroperiods and that the interaction is sensitive to wave\namplitude, wave frequency and electron energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2000 15:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
