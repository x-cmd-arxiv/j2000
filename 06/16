Models with softly broken N =1 supersymmetry were\nextensively studied and are phenomenologically successful. However, it could be\nthat an extended N = 2 supersymmetry survives to low energies, as suggested by\nvarious constructions. We examine the phenomenological viability and\nimplications of such a scenario. We show that consistent chiral fermion mass\ngeneration emerges in N=2 theories, which are vectorial, as a result of\nsupersymmetry breaking at low energies. A rich mirror quark and lepton spectrum\nnear the weak scale with model-dependent decay modes is predicted. A Z_{2}\nmirror parity is shown to play an important role in determining the\nphenomenology of the models. It leads, if conserved, to a new stable particle,\nthe LMP. Consistency of the N=2 framework and its unique spectrum with\nelectroweak precision data is considered, and the discovery potential in the\nnext generation of hadron collider experiments is stressed. Mirror quark pair\nproduction provides the most promising discovery channel. Higgs searches are\nalso discussed and it is shown that there is no upper bound on the prediction\nfor the Higgs boson mass in the framework of low-energy supersymmetry breaking,\nin general, and in the N=2 framework, in particular.

It has non-negative integer entries, is normalized and\ncommutes with the S- and T-matrices arising from the braiding. Thus it is a\nphysical modular invariant in the usual sense of rational conformal field\ntheory. The algebraic treatment of conformal field theory models, e.g.\n$SU(n)_k$ models, produces subfactors which realize their known modular\ninvariants. Several properties of modular invariants have so far been noticed\nempirically and considered mysterious such as their intimate relationship to\ngraphs, as for example the A-D-E classification for $SU(2)_k$.

Despite that both theories describe our time-space world, no one has\nsucceeded in arriving at one of these theories by using the other one,\ndeductively. Fusion of these two theories produced quantum field theory.\nHowever this theory impresses us as a theory that was made by merging the two\ntheories by force. So this theory cannot indicate the reason why both\nrelativity theory and quantum mechanics exist in this world at the same time.\nHere I show you that quantum mechanics can be led by the equation of\nMinkowski's metrics, which stands up in the relativistic world of space and\ntime. This is the first report proving mathematically that quantum mechanics\ncan be born reductively in our relativistic world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2000 03:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nphenomenon appears in an isolated quantum computer without any external\ndecoherence. The onset of quantum chaos leads to quantum computer hardware\nmelting, strong quantum entropy growth and destruction of computer operability.\nThe time scales for development of quantum chaos and ergodicity are determined.\nIn spite the fact that this phenomenon is rather dangerous for quantum\ncomputing it is shown that the quantum chaos border for inter-qubit coupling is\nexponentially larger than the energy level spacing between quantum computer\neigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result\nthe ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against\nimperfections. This opens a broad parameter region for a possible realization\nof quantum computer.
