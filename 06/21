The local\nfluctuations (on a set of fixed trajectory segments) from the average heat\nentropy absorbed in thermostat were found to be non-Gaussian. Approximately,\nthe fluctuations can be discribed by a two-Gaussian distribution with a\ncrossover independent of the segment length and the number of trajectories\n('particles'). The distribution itself does depend on both, approaching the\nsingle standard Gaussian distribution as any of those parameters increases. The\nglobal time-dependent fluctuations turned out to be qualitatively different in\nthat they have a strict upper bound much less than the average entropy\nproduction. Thus, unlike the equilibrium steady state, the recovery of the\ninitial low entropy becomes impossible, after a sufficiently long time, even in\nthe largest fluctuations. However, preliminary numerical experiments and the\ntheoretical estimates in the special case of the critical dynamics with\nsuperdiffusion suggest the existence of infinitely many Poincar\\'e recurrences\nto the initial state and beyond.
