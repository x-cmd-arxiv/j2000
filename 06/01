The spectra are fit\nto a model including multicolor blackbody disk and power-law components. The\nsource is observed in the very high and high/soft outburst states of black hole\nX-ray novae.

The lamppost\nspectra contain several spectroscopic features characteristic of highly ionized\nmaterial that are not seen in the X-ray spectra of most AGN. The magnetic flare\nmodel, on the other hand, produces reflected spectra that are roughly a\nsuper-position of a power-law and a {\\em neutral-like} reflection and iron\nK$\\alpha$ line, and are thus more in line with typical AGN X-ray spectra.\nFurthermore, because of the difference in the ionization structure of the\nilluminated material in the two models, the line equivalent width increases\nwith the X-ray luminosity, $L_x$, for the lamppost, and decreases with $L_x$\nfor the flare model. In light of these theoretical insights, recent iron line\nreverberation studies of AGN, the X-ray Baldwin effect, and the general lack of\nX-ray reflection features in distant quasars all suggest that, for high\naccretion rates, the cold accretion disk is covered by a Thomson thick,\ncompletely ionized skin.

This procedure\nseparates the issue of quantization from enforcing the constraints caused by\nthe general covariance symmetries. The resulting theory, unlike the standard\napproach, takes into account the states that are off shell with respect to the\nconstraints, and thus avoids the problems of time. In this approach, quantum\ngeometrodynamics, general covariance, and the interpretation of time emerge\ntogether as parts of the solution of the total problem of geometrodynamic\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2000 23:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}
