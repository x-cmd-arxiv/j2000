Spiral arm modulation may be understood in terms of interference\npatterns of outgoing and incoming density wave packets or modes. The brightness\nalong a spiral arm will be increased where two wave crests meet and\nconstructively interfere, but will be decreased where a wave crest and a wave\ntrough destructively interfere. Spiral arm modulation has hitherto only been\ndetected in grand design spirals (such as Messier 81). Spiral arm amplitude\nvariations have the potential to become a powerful constraint for the study of\ngalactic dynamics. We illustrate our method in two galaxies: NGC 4062 and NGC\n5248. In both cases, we have detected trailing and leading m=2 waves with\nsimilar pitch angles. This suggests that the amplification mechanism is the\nWASER type II. In this mechanism, the bulge region reflects (rather than\nrefracts) incoming waves with no change of pitch angle, but only a change of\ntheir sense of winding. The ratio between the amplitudes of the leading and the\ntrailing waves is about 0.5 in both cases, wherein the higher amplitude is\nconsistently assigned to the trailing (as opposed to leading) mode. The results\nare particularly significant because NGC 5248 is an optically grand design\ngalaxy, whereas NGC 4062 is optically flocculent.

LINERs are observed in approximately\none third of galaxies in the local universe and it has been often thought that\nthey harbor an AGN-like central engine with moderate activity. However, some\nLINERs show no direct evidence for AGNs such as broad emission lines, radio\njets, hard X-ray emission, spectral energy distributions which are inconsistent\nwith starlight, and so on. For such LINERs (a subset of type 2 LINERs), we\npresent new poststarburst models which explain some of their most important\noptical narrow emission-line ratios. In these models, the ionization sources\nare planetary nebula nuclei (PNNs) with temperature of ~ 10^5 K which appear in\nthe late-phase evolution of intermediate-mass stars with mass between ~ 3\nM_solar and ~ 6 M_solar. Such PNNs left in a typical starburst nucleus can\nproduce an Halpha luminosity of L(Halpha) ~ 10^38 ergs s^-1 for typical\npoststarburst LINERs and ~ 10^39 ergs s^-1 only in exceptionally bright cases.\nThe PNN phase lasts until the death of the lowest-mass stars formed in the\nstarburst, which is ~ 5 x 10^8 yr for an assumed lower limit of the initial\nmass function of 3 M_solar. This long duration appears consistent with the\nobserved higher frequency of occurrence of LINERs if every galaxy could\nexperience the starburst activity several times in its life. We therefore\npropose that some LINERs which show no direct evidence for AGNs may be\npoststarburst nuclei powered by a cluster of PNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2000 23:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

To facilitate the introduction of such techniques into radio\nastronomy, we formulate the astronomical problem in an array signal processing\nlanguage, and give an introduction to some elementary algorithms from that\nfield. We consider two topics in detail: interference detection by rank\nestimation of short-term covariance matrices, and spatial filtering by subspace\nestimation and projection. We discuss experimental data collected at the\nWesterbork radio telescope, and illustrate the effectiveness of the space-time\ndetection and blanking process on the recovery of a 3C48 absorption line in the\npresence of GSM mobile telephony interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2000 11:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Most observations can be understood in the framework of the reduced\nHilbert space dimension 2S+1=21. Due to the large spin S=10, the energy barrier\npreventing spin rotation is large, and as a consequence, quantum relaxation is\nvery slow. The application of a magnetic field of a few Tesla below 1 K allows\nto observe tunneling (i) between the states m=-10 and m=10-n with n=8 to 11 if\nthe field is longitudinal, or (ii) between the two ground-states m~-10 and m~10\nif the field is transverse. The crossover temperature between ground-state and\nthermally assisted tunneling in a longitudinal field extrapolates in zero field\nat ~1.7 K. The observation of square root relaxation at\nshort-times/low-temperatures and of exponential relaxation at\nlong-times/high-temperatures, as observed previously above 1.5 K, confirms the\nimportant role of the spin bath dynamics which is out of equilibrium in the\nfirst regime and at equilibrium in the second one. In a second part of this\npaper a new molecule, so-called V15, with resultant spin S=1/2 is investigated.\nContrary to high spin molecules, the energy barrier of low spin molecules is\nsmall or null, and the splitting between the symmetrical and anti-symmetrical\nstates is sufficiently large to allow spin-phonon transitions during spin\nrotation.

Motivated by this experiment, this\nwork studies numerically the dynamics of the vortex tangle without the mutual\nfriction, thus showing that a self-similar cascade process, whereby large\nvortex loops break up to smaller ones, proceeds in the vortex tangle and is\nclosely related with its free decay. This cascade process which may be covered\nwith the mutual friction at higher temperatures is just the one at zero\ntemperature Feynman proposed long ago. The full Biot-Savart calculation is made\nfor dilute vortices, while the localized induction approximation is used for a\ndense tangle. The former finds the elementary scenario: the reconnection of the\nvortices excites vortex waves along them and makes them kinked, which could be\nsuppressed if the mutual friction worked. The kinked parts reconnect with the\nvortex they belong to, dividing into small loops. The latter simulation under\nthe localized induction approximation shows that such cascade process actually\nproceeds self-similarly in a dense tangle and continues to make small vortices.\nConsidering that the vortices of the interatomic size no longer keep the\npicture of vortex, the cascade process leads to the decay of the vortex line\ndensity. The presence of the cascade process is supported also by investigating\nthe classification of the reconnection type and the size distribution of\nvortices. The decay of the vortex line density is consistent with the solution\nof the Vinen's equation which was originally derived on the basis of the idea\nof homogeneous turbulence with the cascade process. The obtained result is\ncompared with the recent Vinen's theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2000 11:15:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2000 08:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We point out problems for existing FESR\ntreatments associated with potentially slow convergence of the perturbative\nseries for the mass-dependent terms in the OPE over certain parts of the FESR\ncontour, and show how to construct alternate weight choices which not only cure\nthis problem, but also (1) considerably improve the convergence of the\nintegrated perturbative series, (2) strongly suppress contributions from the\nregion of s values where the errors on the strange current spectral function\nare still large and (3) essentially completely remove uncertainties associated\nwith the subtraction of longitudinal contributions to the experimental decay\ndistributions. The result is an extraction of m_s with statistical errors\ncomparable to those associated with the current experimental uncertainties in\nthe determination of the CKM angle, V_{us}. We find m_s(1 GeV)=158.6\\pm 18.7\\pm\n16.3\\pm 13.3 MeV (where the first error is statistical, the second due to that\non V_{us}, and the third theoretical).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2000 20:38:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2000 22:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
