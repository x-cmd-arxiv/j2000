Advection\ndominated accretion flows (ADAFs) were proposed to interpret such a difference.\nThe residual optical/UV emission of quiescent LMXRTs, after subtraction of the\ncompanion star spectrum, is produced by synchrotron radiation in the (latest\nversion) of ADAF and therefore is part of the ADAF's luminosity budget. We\ndemonstrate that, once the residual optical/UV emission is taken into account,\nthe bolometric luminosity swing of BHCs is consistent with that of NSs. We\nexplore here an alternative scenario to ADAFs in which very little mass\naccretion onto the collapsed star takes place in the quiescence intervals. The\nresidual optical/UV emission of BHCs are expected to derive from the energy\nreleased by the matter transferred from the companion star at radii comparable\nto the circularisation radius. The quiescent X-ray luminosity originates either\nfrom accretion onto the BH at very low rates and/or from coronal activity in\nthe companion star or in the outer disk. For comparably small mass inflow\nrates, the NSs in these systems are likely in the radio pulsar regime. In the\ninteraction of the radio pulsar relativistic wind with matter transferred from\nthe companion star, a shock forms, the power law-like emission of which powers\nboth the harder X-ray emission and most of the residual optical/UV. The soft,\nthermal-like X-ray component may arise from the cooling of the NS surface. This\nscenario matches well both the X-ray and bolometric luminosity swing of LMXRTs.\n(ABRIDGED).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2000 03:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
