A simple criterium defining the\nboundaries of this cone is determined. The Q^2 dependence of the effect of\noff-shell ambiguities on the different (e,e'p) structure functions is\naddressed. At sufficiently high values of Q^2 their impact on the cross\nsections is illustrated to become practically negligible. It is pointed out\nthat for the whole range of Q^2 values studied here, the bulk of the\nrelativistic effects arising from the coupling between the lower components in\nthe wave functions, is manifesting itself in the longitudinal-transverse\ninterference term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2000 09:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Premelting effects are nevertheless more important and more easily\nestablished in potasium clusters, and the transition regions spread over\ntemperature intervals which are wider than in the case of sodium. For all the\nsizes considered, the percentage melting temperature reduction when passing\nfrom Na to K clusters is substantially larger than in the bulk. Once those two\nmaterials have been compared for a number of different cluster sizes, we study\nthe melting-like transition in Rb_55 and Cs_55 clusters and make a comparison\nwith the melting behavior of Na_55 and K_55. As the atomic number increases,\nthe height of the specific heat peaks decreases, their width increases, and the\nmelting temperature decreases as in bulk melting, but in a more pronounced way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2000 09:21:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 2001 13:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
