The imaging data presented in this paper has been painstakingly\nreduced and calibrated to allow accurate surface photometry of features as\nfaint as 30 mag/sqr-arcsec in B and 29 mag/sqr-arcsec in R on scales larger\nthan 10 arcsec. Due to limitations in sky subtraction and flat fielding, the\ninfrared data can reach only to 22.5 mag/sqr-arcsec in K_s on comparable\nscales. As part of this work, we have developed a new method for quantifying\nthe reliability of surface photometry, which provides useful diagnostics for\nthe presence of scattered light, optical emission from infrared cirrus, and\nother sources of non-uniform sky backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2000 01:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
