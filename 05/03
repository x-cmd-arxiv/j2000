With their\nsensitive all-sky observation, MAP and Planck satellites should be able to\ndetect weak non-Gaussianity in the CMB sky. On large angular scale, there is a\nsimple relationship between the CMB temperature and the primordial curvature\nperturbation. On smaller scales; however, the radiation transfer function\nbecomes more complex. In this paper, we present the angular bispectrum of the\nprimary CMB anisotropy that uses the full transfer function. We find that the\nbispectrum has a series of acoustic peaks that change a sign, and a period of\nacoustic oscillations is twice as long as that of the angular power spectrum.\nUsing a single non-linear coupling parameter to characterize the amplitude of\nthe bispectrum, we estimate the expected signal-to-noise ratio for COBE, MAP,\nand Planck experiments. We find that the detection of the primary bispectrum by\nany kind of experiments should be problematic for the simple slow-roll\ninflationary scenarios. We compare the sensitivity of the primary bispectrum to\nthe primary skewness and conclude that when we can compute the predicted form\nof the bispectrum, it becomes a ``matched filter'' for detecting the\nnon-Gaussianity in the data, and much more powerful tool than the skewness. We\nalso show that MAP and Planck can separate the primary bispectrum from various\nsecondary bispectra on the basis of the shape difference. The primary CMB\nbispectrum is a test of the inflationary scenario, and also a probe of the\nnon-linear physics in the very early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2000 20:03:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2000 02:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}

Cumulative and differential flare rate distributions were\nconstructed and fitted with different methods. Power laws are found to\napproximately describe the distributions. A trend toward flatter distributions\nfor later-type stars is suggested in our sample. Assuming that the power laws\ncontinue below the detection limit, we have estimated that the superposition of\nflares with radiated energies of about $10^{29}-10^{31}$ergs could explain the\nobserved radiative power loss of these coronae, while the detected flares are\ncontributing only $\\approx 10$%. While the power-law index is not correlated\nwith rotation parameters (rotation period, projected rotational velocity,\nRossby number) and only marginally with the X-ray luminosity, the flare\noccurrence rate is correlated with all of them. The occurrence rate of flares\nwith energies larger than $10^{32}$ergs is found to be proportional to the\naverage total stellar X-ray luminosity. Thus, energetic flares occur more often\nin X-ray bright stars than in X-ray faint stars. The normalized occurrence rate\nof flares with energies larger than $10^{32}$ergs increases with increasing\n\\lxlbol and stays constant for saturated stars. A similar saturation is found\nbelow a critical Rossby number.

It is shown that in\nthe limit where the fluctuations and couplings are small compared to one-qubit\nenergy spacing the spectrum has a band structure and a renormalized Hamiltonian\nis obtained which describes the eigenstate properties inside one band. The\nstudies are concentrated on the central band of the computer (``core'') with\nthe highest density of states. We show that above a critical inter-qubit\ncoupling strength, quantum chaos sets in, leading to quantum ergodicity of the\ncomputer eigenstates. In this regime the ideal qubit structure disappears, the\neigenstates become complex and the operability of the computer is quickly\ndestroyed. We confirm that the quantum chaos border decreases only linearly\nwith the number of qubits n, although the spacing between multi-qubit states\ndrops exponentially with n. The investigation of time-evolution in the quantum\ncomputer shows that in the quantum chaos regime, an ideal (noninteracting)\nstate quickly disappears and exponentially many states become mixed after a\nshort chaotic time scale for which the dependence on system parameters is\ndetermined. Below the quantum chaos border an ideal state can survive for long\ntimes and be used for computation. The results show that a broad parameter\nregion does exist where the efficient operation of a quantum computer is\npossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2000 17:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
