Trend- removal\ncan be easily applied to spectra where continuum-fitting is difficult, such as\nwhen the resolution or signal-to-noise is low, or for spectra at high\nredshifts. Furthermore, a measurement of the continuum power spectrum using\ntrend-removal, from either low redshift quasar spectra or the red-side of\nLyman-alpha, allows in principle the removal of spurious power introduced by\nthe continuum and thereby expanding scales probed to larger ones. We also\nderive expressions for the shot-noise bias and variance of the power spectrum\nestimate, taking into account the non-Poissonian nature of the shot-noise and\nthe non-Gaussianity of the cosmic fluctuations.

Recent studies of upscattering and energy\nloss by relativistic electrons that have used the non-relativistic, magnetic\nThomson cross section for resonant scattering or the Klein-Nishina cross\nsection for non-resonant scattering do not account for the relativistic quantum\neffects of strong fields ($ > 4 \\times 10^{12}$ G). We have derived a\nsimplified expression for the exact QED scattering cross section for the\nbroadly-applicable case where relativistic electrons move along the magnetic\nfield. To facilitate applications to astrophysical models, we have also\ndeveloped compact approximate expressions for both the differential and total\npolarization-dependent cross sections, with the latter representing well the\nexact total QED cross section even at the high fields believed to be present in\nenvironments near the stellar surfaces of Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters and\nAnomalous X-Ray Pulsars. We find that strong magnetic fields significantly\nlower the Compton scattering cross section below and at the resonance, when the\nincident photon energy exceeds $m_ec^2$ in the electron rest frame. The cross\nsection is strongly dependent on the polarization of the final scattered\nphoton. Below the cyclotron fundamental, mostly photons of perpendicular\npolarization are produced in scatterings, a situation that also arises above\nthis resonance for sub-critical fields. However, an interesting discovery is\nthat for super-critical fields, a preponderance of photons of parallel\npolarization results from scatterings above the cyclotron fundamental. This\ncharacteristic is both a relativistic and magnetic effect not present in the\nThomson or Klein-Nishina limits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2000 01:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is known observationally that the\nearly-type spiral sample has a wider range of the present star formation rate\n(SFR) than the late-type sample. This tendency is understood in the framework\nof the limit-cycle model of the interstellar medium (ISM), in which the SFR\ncyclically changes in accordance with the temporal variation of the mass\nfraction of the three ISM components. When the limit-cycle model of the ISM is\napplied, the amplitude of variation of the SFR is expected to change with the\nsupernova (SN) rate. Observational evidence indicates that the early-type\nspiral galaxies show smaller rates of present SN than late-type ones. Combining\nthis evidence with the limit-cycle model of the ISM, we predict that the\nearly-type spiral galaxies show larger amplitudes in their SFR variation than\nthe late-types. Indeed, this prediction is consistent with the observed wider\nrange of the SFR in the early-type sample than in the late-type sample.

A Clifford statistics,\nrepresenting a swap (12) by a difference $\\gamma_1-\\gamma_2$ of Clifford units,\nis uniquely appropriate. Unlike the Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac,\nBose-Einstein, and para- statistics, which are tensorial and single-valued, and\nunlike anyons, which are confined to two dimensions, Clifford statistics are\nmultivalued and work for any dimensionality. Nayak and Wilczek proposed a\nClifford statistics for the fractional quantum Hall effect. We apply them to\ntoy quanta here. A complex-Clifford example has the energy spectrum of a system\nof spin-1/2 particles in an external magnetic field. This supports the proposal\nthat the double-valued rotations --- spin --- seen at current energies might\narise from double-valued permutations --- swap --- to be seen at higher\nenergies. Another toy with real Clifford statistics illustrates how an\neffective imaginary unit $i$ can arise naturally within a real quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2000 06:41:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2001 17:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

A. Amitsur in 1955. In case $K$ has\ncharacteristic $p>0$, the only possible finite subgroups of $K^*$ are cyclic\ngroups, according to a theorem of I. N. Herstein. Thus, the only interesting\ncase is when $K$ has characteristic 0; that is, when $K\\supseteq {\\Bbb Q}$.\n  Herstein conjectured that odd-order subgroups of division rings $K$ were\ncyclic, and he proved this to be the case when $K$ is the division ring of the\nreal quaternions. Herstein's conjecture was settled negatively by Amitsur. As\npart of his complete classification of finite groups in division rings, Amitsur\nshowed that the smallest noncyclic odd-order group that can be embedded in a\ndivision ring is one of order 63 (and this group is unique).\n  Amitsur's paper is daunting to read as it is long and technically\ncomplicated. In lecturing to a graduate class on division rings, I tried to\nfind a simple reason for the ``first exceptional odd order'' 63 (to Herstein's\nconjecture).

To better motivate the results discussed here,\nI have also included a quick exposition on the beginning part of the theory of\nfinite subgroups of division rings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2000 19:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A recent report by Tegmark finds that microtubules can maintain\nquantum coherence for only $10^{-13}$ s, far too short to be\nneurophysiologically relevant. Here, we critically examine the assumptions\nbehind Tegmark's calculation and find that: 1) Tegmark's commentary is not\naimed at an existing model in the literature but rather at a hybrid that\nreplaces the superposed protein conformations of the `Orch OR' theory with a\nsoliton in superposition along the microtubule, 2) Tegmark predicts decreasing\ndecoherence times at lower temperature, in direct contradiction of the observed\nbehavior of quantum states, 3) recalculation after correcting Tegmark's\nequation for differences between his model and the `Orch OR' model\n(superposition separation, charge vs. dipole, dielectric constant) lengthens\nthe decoherence time to $10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ s and invalidates a critical\nassumption of Tegmark's derivation, 4) incoherent metabolic energy supplied to\nthe collective dynamics ordering water in the vicinity of microtubules at a\nrate exceeding that of decoherence can counter decoherence effects (in the same\nway that lasers avoid decoherence at room temperature), and 5) phases of actin\ngelation may enhance the ordering of water around microtubule bundles, further\nincreasing the decoherence-free zone by an order of magnitude and the\ndecoherence time to $10^{-2} - 10^{-1}$ s.
