Large-scale shocks result from accretion onto sheets, filaments and\nGalaxy Clusters (GCs) on a scale of circa 5 Mpc/h in both cases. Energetic\nmotions, both residual of past accretion history and due to current asymmetric\ninflow along filaments, generate additional, common shocks on a scale of about\n1 Mpc/h, which penetrate deep inside GCs. Also collisions between substructures\ninside GCs form merger shocks. Consequently, the topology of the shocks is very\ncomplex and highly connected. During cosmic evolution the comoving shock\nsurface density decreases, reflecting the ongoing structure merger process in\nboth scenarios. Accretion shocks have very high Mach numbers (10-10^3), when\nphoto-heating of the pre-shock gas is not included. The typical shock speed is\nof order v_{sh}(z) =H(z)lambda_{NL}(z), with lambda_{NL}(z) the wavelength\nscale of the nonlinear perturbation at the given epoch.

Here we explore several mechanisms for an\nupper mass cutoff, including an exponential decline of the star formation\nprobability after a turbulent crossing time. The results are in good agreement\nwith the observed IMF over the entire stellar mass range, and they give a\ngradual turn down compared to the Salpeter function above ~100 Msun for normal\nthermal Jeans mass, M_J. The upper mass turn down should scale with M_J in\ndifferent environments. A problem with the models is that they cannot give both\nthe observed power-law IMF out to the high-mass sampling limit in dense\nclusters, as well as the observed lack of supermassive stars in whole galaxy\ndisks. Either there is a sharper upper-mass cutoff in the IMF, perhaps from\nself-limitation, or the IMF is different for dense clusters than for the\nmajority of star formation that occurs at lower density.

In fact, the resulting stress-\nmomentum-energy tensor can provide a unified account of both the elastic and\nthe inertial properties of uncharged matter. The extension of the displacement\nvector to the four dimensions of spacetime allows a further possibility. If the\nreal displacement four-vector is complemented with an imaginary part, the\nresulting complex ``displacement'' four-vector allows for a complex, Hermitian\ngeneralisation of the four-dimensional Hooke's law. Let the complex, Hermitian\n``stress-momentum-energy'' tensor density built in this way be subjected to the\nusual conservation condition. It turns out that, while the real part of the\nlatter equation is able to account for the motion of electrically charged,\nelastic matter, the imaginary part of the same equation can describe the\nevolution of the electromagnetic field and of its sources.

The focus is on the study of the relaxation of gauge and\nfermionic mean fields and on the quantum kinetics of the photon and fermion\ndistribution functions. For semihard photons of momentum eT << k << T we find\nto leading order in the HTL that the gauge mean field relaxes in time with a\npower law as a result of infrared enhancement of the spectral density near the\nLandau damping threshold.

The goal of the present paper is twofold. First, we clarify the\nrelationship between formal Morita equivalence, Ara's notion of Morita\n$^*$-equivalence of rings with involution, and strong Morita equivalence of\n$C^*$-algebras. Second, in the general setting of $^*$-algebras over $\\ring C$,\nwe define `closed' $^*$-ideals as the ones occuring as kernels of\n$^*$-representations of these algebras on pre-Hilbert spaces. These ideals form\na lattice which we show is invariant under formal Morita equivalence. This\nresult, when applied to Pedersen ideals of $C^*$-algebras, recovers the\nso-called Rieffel correspondence theorem. The triviality of the minimal element\nin the lattice of closed ideals, called the `minimal ideal', is also a formal\nMorita invariant and this fact can be used to describe a large class of\nexamples of $^*$-algebras over $\\ring C$ with equivalent representation theory\nbut which are not formally Morita equivalent.
