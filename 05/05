Many\nof the general features of galaxies observed at optical wavelengths---spiral\narms, disks, rings, and bright knots of emission---are also seen in the\nmid-infrared, except the prominent optical bulges are absent at 6.75 and 15\nmicrons. In addition, the maps are quite similar at 6.75 and 15 microns, except\nfor a few cases where a central starburst leads to lower 6.75/15 ratios in the\ninner region. We also present infrared flux densities and mid-infrared sizes\nfor these galaxies. The mid-infrared color 6.75/15 shows a distinct trend with\nthe far-infrared color 60/100. The quiescent galaxies in our sample (60/100 <\n0.6) show 6.75/15 near unity, whereas this ratio drops significantly for\ngalaxies with higher global heating intensity levels. Azimuthally-averaged\nsurface brightness profiles indicate the extent to which the mid-infrared flux\nis centrally concentrated, and provide information on the radial dependence of\nmid-infrared colors. The galaxies are mostly well resolved in these maps:\nalmost half of them have < 10% of their flux in the central resolution element.\nA comparison of optical and mid-infrared isophotal profiles indicates that the\noptical flux at 4400 Angstroms near the optical outskirts of the galaxies is\napproximately eight (seven) times that at 6.75 microns (15 microns), comparable\nwith observations of the diffuse quiescent regions of the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2000 20:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We perform both theoretical\nanalysis and experimental tests using realistically simulated data streams in\norder to fix the statistical properties of the signal and the maximal\ncompression rate allowed by several lossless compression algorithms. We studied\nthe influence of signal composition and of acquisition parameters on the\ncompression rate Cr and develop a semiempirical formalism to account for it.\nThe best performing compressor tested up to now is the arithmetic compression\nof order 1, designed for optimizing the compression of white noise like\nsignals, which allows an overall compression rate <Cr> = 2.65 +/- 0.02. We find\nthat such result is not improved by other lossless compressors, being the\nsignal almost white noise dominated. Lossless compression algorithms alone will\nnot solve the bandwidth problem but needs to be combined with other techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2000 11:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The model is based on the alpha-viscosity,\nincludes self-gravity, convective transport and turbulent pressure. A few\nproperties of the model are discussed for circumstellar and AGN discs.\n  We show the strong sensitivity of the disc structure to the viscous energy\ndeposition towards the vertical axis, specially when entering inside the\nself-gravitating part of the disc. The local version of the alpha-prescription\nleads to a \"singular\" behavior which is also predicted by the vertically\naveraged model. With respect, a much softer transition is observed with the\n  \"alpha-P\" formalism. Turbulent pressure is important only for alpha > 0.1. It\nlowers vertical density gradients, significantly thickens the disc, tends to\nwash out density inversions and pushes the self-gravitating region to slightly\nlarger radii. Curves localizing the inner edge of the self-gravitating disc as\nfunctions of the viscosity parameter and accretion rate are given. The lower\nalpha, the closer to the center the self-gravitating regime, and the\nsensitivity to the accretion rate is generally weak, except for alpha < 0.1.\nThis study suggests that models aiming to describe T-Tauri discs beyond about a\nfew to a few tens astronomical units from the central protostar using the\nalpha-theory should consider vertical self-gravity. The Primitive Solar Nebula\nwas probably a bit (if not strongly) self-gravitating at the actual orbit of\ngiant planets. Alpha-discs hosted by active galaxies are self-gravitating\nbeyond about a thousand Schwarzchild radii. The inferred surface density\nremains too high to lower the accretion time scale.

The radiative transfer is carried out at several\nwavelength in the Ultraviolet, optical and Near Infrared, to cover the range of\nthe stellar Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). Together with the images of the\ngalactic model, a map of the energy absorbed by dust is produced. Using\nGalactic dust properties, the spatial distribution of dust temperature is\nderived under the assumption of thermal equilibrium. A correction is applied\nfor non-equilibrium emission in the Mid Infrared. Images of dust emission can\nthen be produced at any wavelength in the FIR.\n  We show the application of the model to the spiral galaxy NGC 6946.

The picture of electron waves moving in a cristalline potential and\ninteracting weakly with each other and with cristalline vibrations suffices to\nexplain the properties of technologically important materials such as\nsemiconductors and also simple metals that become superconductors. In magnetic\nmaterials, the relevant picture is that of electrons that are completely\nlocalized, spin being left as the only relevant degree of freedom. A number of\nrecently discovered materials with unusual properties do not fit in any of\nthese two limiting cases. These challenging materials are generally very\nanisotropic, either quasi one-dimensional or quasi two-dimensional, and in\naddition their electrons interact strongly but not enough to be completely\nlocalized. High temperature superconductors and certain organic conductors fall\nin the latter category. This paper discusses how the effect of low dimension\nleads to new paradigms in the one-dimensional case (Luttinger liquids,\nspin-charge separation), and indicates some of the attempts that are being\nundertaken to develop, concurrently, new methodology and new concepts for the\nquasi-two-dimensional case, especially relevant to high-temperature\nsuperconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 May 2000 14:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
