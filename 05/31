First, the importance of coherence effects\n(Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect) on production and absorption of field quanta\nin non-equilibrium dense matter is considered. It is shown that classical\ndiffusion and Langevin results correspond to re-summation of certain\nfield-theory diagrams formulated in terms of full non-equilibrium Green's\nfunctions. Then the general properties of broad resonances in dense and hot\nsystems are discussed in the framework of a self-consistent and conserving\nPhi-derivable method of Baym at the examples of the rho-meson in hadronic\nmatter and the pion in dilute nuclear matter. Further we address the problem of\na transport description that properly accounts for the damping width of the\nparticles. The Phi-derivable method generalized to the real-time contour\nprovides a self-consistent and conserving kinetic scheme. We derive a\ngeneralized expression for the non-equilibrium kinetic entropy flow, which\nincludes corrections from fluctuations and mass-width effects. In special cases\nan H-theorem is proved. Memory effects in collision terms give contributions to\nthe kinetic entropy flow that in the Fermi-liquid case recover the famous\nbosonic type T^3 ln T correction to the specific heat of liquid Helium-3. At\nthe example of the pion-condensate phase transition in dense nuclear matter we\ndemonstrate important part played by the width effects within the quantum\ntransport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2000 11:24:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2000 15:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

In the limit where\nthe ancilla responds to fluctuations on a much shorter time scale than does the\nsystem, we show that it can be adiabatically eliminated, yielding a master\nequation for the system alone. This is very significant as it decreases the\nnecessary basis size for numerical simulation and allows the effect of the\nancilla to be understood more easily. We consider two types of ancilla: a\ntwo-level ancilla (e.g. a two-level atom) and an infinite-level ancilla (e.g.\nan optical mode). For each, we consider two forms of feedback: coherent (for\nwhich a quantum mechanical description of the feedback loop is required) and\nincoherent (for which a classical description is sufficient). We test the\nmaster equations we obtain using numerical simulation of the full dynamics of\nthe compound system. For the system (a parametric oscillator) and feedback\n(intensity-dependent detuning) we choose, good agreement is found in the limit\nof heavy damping of the ancilla. We discuss the relation of our work to\nprevious work on feedback in compound quantum systems, and also to previous\nwork on adiabatic elimination in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2000 01:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
