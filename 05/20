In this paper\nwe study a recently defined [3, 8, 9] condition called locally nonconical\nconvexity (abbreviated LNC). Is is easy to show that every strictly convex set\nis LNC, as are half-spaces and finite intersections of sets of either of these\ntypes, but many more sets are LNC. For instance, every zonoid (the range of a\nnonatomic vector-valued measure) is LNC (Corollary 34). However, there are no\ninfinite-dimensional compact LNC sets (Theorem 23).\n  The LNC concept originated in a search for continuous sections, and the\npresent paper shows how it leads naturally (and constructively) to continuous\nsections in a variety of situations. Let Q be a compact, convex set in R^n, and\nlet T be a linear map from R^n into R^m. We show (Theorem 1) that Q is LNC if\nand only if the restriction of any such T to Q is an open map of Q onto T(Q).\nThis implies that if Q is LNC, then any such T has continuous sections (i.e.\nthere are continuous right inverses of T) that map from T(Q) to Q, and in fact\nit is possible to define continuous sections constructively in various natural\nways (Theorem 3, Corollary 4, and Theorem 5). If Q is strictly convex and T is\nnot 1-1, we can construct continuous sections which take values in the boundary\nof Q (Theorem 6).\n  When we give up compactness it is natural to consider a closed, convex, LNC\nsubset Q of a Hilbert space X which may be infinite-dimensional. In this case\nwe must assume that T is left Fredholm, i.e. a bounded linear map with closed\nrange and finite-dimensional kernel. We can then prove results analogous to\nthose mentioned in the last paragraph (Theorems 16-20).

Lett. 6 (1999)\n681-696], there are 4-manifolds for which the diffeomorphism group does not act\ntransitively on the deformation classes of orientation-compatible symplectic\nstructures. This note points out some other 4-manifolds with this property\nwhich arise as the orientation-reversed versions of certain complex surfaces\nconstructed by Kodaira [J. Analyse Math. 19 (1967) 207-215]. While this\nconstruction is arguably simpler than that of McMullen and Taubes, its\nsimplicity comes at a price: the examples exhibited herein all have large\nfundamental groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2000 19:40:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2000 17:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-11"}

The group\nis determined from the Weierstrass model, which has singularities that are\ngenerically rational double points; these double points lead to local factors\nof $G$ which are either the corresponding A-D-E groups or some associated\nnon-simply laced groups.\n  The representation $\\rho$ is a sum of representations coming from the local\nfactors of $G$, and of other representations which can be associated to the\npoints at which the singularities are worse than generic.\n  This construction first arose in physics, and the requirement of anomaly\ncancellation in the associated physical theory makes some surprising\npredictions about the connection between $X$ and $\\rho$. In particular, an\nexplicit formula (in terms of $\\rho$) for the Euler characteristic of $X$ is\npredicted. We give a purely mathematical proof of that formula in this paper,\nintroducing along the way a new invariant of elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds. We\nalso verify the other geometric predictions which are consequences of anomaly\ncancellation, under some (mild) hypotheses about the types of singularities\nwhich occur.\n  As a byproduct we also discover a novel relation between the Coxeter number\nand the rank in the case of the simply laced groups in the ``exceptional\nseries'' studied by Deligne.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2000 20:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

This puts on a firm ground a\nknown statement that the algebra $\\cal{A}$ ``looks and behaves like a universal\nenveloping algebra''. An immediate corollary of our result is the conjecture of\nBar-Natan, Garoufalidis, Rozansky, and Thurston on the Kirillov-Duflo\nisomorphism for algebras of chord diagrams.\n  Our main tool is a general construction of a functor from the category\n$\\mathtt{CycOp}$ of cyclic operads to the category $\\mathtt{ModOp}$ of modular\noperads which is left adjoint to the ``tree part'' functor $\\mathtt{ModOp} \\to\n\\mathtt{CycOp}$.
