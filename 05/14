Within the\ncoupled-channels formalism, this letter first shows the limitations of the\nstandard coupled-channels theory in the case where one of the nuclei in the\nreaction is strongly deformed and then, demonstrates that a global solution to\nthe problems of light heavy-ion reactions such as $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C,\n$^{16}$O+$^{28}$Si and $^{12}$C+$^{24}$Mg can be found using a new\nsecond-derivative coupling potential in the coupled-channels formalism. This\nnew approach consistently improves the agreement with the experimental data for\nthe elastic and inelastic scattering data as well as for their excitation\nfunctions using constant or slightly energy-dependent parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2000 15:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2000 15:56:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 May 2000 16:14:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2001 13:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
