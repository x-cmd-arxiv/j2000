The intrinsic geometry of the horizon is then described by the\nquantum Chern-Simons theory of a U(1) connection on a punctured 2-sphere, the\nhorizon.

The proof of existence of an invariant measure uses the compact\nembedding of some space of uniformly smooth functions into the space of locally\nsquare-integrable functions and a priori bounds on the semi-flow in these\nspaces. The bounds on the entropy follow from spatially localised estimates on\nthe rate of divergence of nearby orbits and on the smoothing effect of the\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2000 13:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
