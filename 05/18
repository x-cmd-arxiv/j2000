Due to the loose bounds on these couplings coming from low\nenergy processes and to the poor sensitivity of hadron colliders to couplings\nsuch as $\\Delta g_Z$, it has been argued that anomalous couplings could still\nproduce an enhancement of Re e'/e bringing this observable closer to the\nexperimental value obtained by KTeV, NA31 and NA48. The impact of the new\nmeasurements done at LEP2 in these years is discussed and new severe\nconstraints to this hypothesis are determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2000 14:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Na_142, whose atoms are distributed in two (surface and\ninner) main shells with different radial distances to the center of mass of the\ncluster, melts in two steps: the first one, at approx. 130 K, is characterized\nby a high intrashell mobility of the atoms, and the second, homogeneous\nmelting, at approx. 270 K, involves diffusive motion of all the atoms across\nthe whole cluster volume (both intrashell and intershell displacements are\nallowed). On the contrary, the melting of Na_92 proceeds gradually over a very\nwide temperature interval, without any abrupt step visible in the thermal or\nstructural melting indicators. The occurrence of well defined steps in the\nmelting transition is then shown to be related to the existence of a\ndistribution of the atoms in shells. Thereby we propose a necessary condition\nfor a cluster to be considered rigorously amorphouslike (totally disordered),\nnamely that there are no space regions of the cluster where the local value of\nthe atomic density is considerably reduced. Na_92 is the only cluster from the\ntwo considered that verifies this condition, so its thermal behavior can be\nconsidered as representative of that expected for amorphous clusters. Na_142,\non the other hand, has a discernible atomic shell structure and should be\nconsidered instead as just partially disordered. The thermal behavior of these\ntwo clusters is also compared to that of icosahedral (totally ordered) sodium\nclusters of the same sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2000 12:15:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
