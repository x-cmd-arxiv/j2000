We find that if the\nstellar envelope were initially slowly rotating, the disk wind would dominate\nthroughout the evolution. If the envelope of the star were rapidly rotating,\nthe stellar wind could initially be of comparable power to the disk wind until\nthe stellar wind carries away the star's angular momentum. Since an initially\nrapidly rotating star can have its spin and magnetic axes misaligned to the\ndisk, multi-polar outflows can result from this disk wind system. For times\ngreater than a spin-down time, the post-AGB stellar wind is slaved to the disk\nfor both slow and rapid initial spin cases and the disk wind luminosity\ndominates. We find a reasonably large parameter space where a hybrid star+disk\nMHD driven wind is plausible and where both or either can account for PPNe and\nPNe powers.

The\nquestion will be investigated in three parts. First, it is shown that the\nLorentz transformation formally stems from the First Relativity Postulate (FRP)\n{\\it alone} if space-time quantization is a fundamental law of physics which\nmust be included as part of the Postulate. An important corollary, however, is\nthat when measuring devices which carry the basic units of lengths and time\n(e.g. a clock ticking every time quantum) are `moving' uniformly, they appear\nto be measuring with larger units. Secondly, such an apparent increase in the\nsizes of the quanta can be attributed to extra fluctuations associated with\nmotion, which are precisely described in terms of a thermally agitated harmonic\noscillator by using a temperature parameter. This provides a stringent\nconstraint on the microscopic properties of flat space-time: it is an array of\nquantized oscillators. Thirdly, since the foregoing development would suggest\nthat the space-time array of an accelerated frame cannot be in thermal\nequilibrium, (i.e. it will have a distribution of temperatures), the approach\nis applied to the case of acceleration by the field of {\\it any} point object,\nwhich corresponds to a temperature `spike' in the array. It is shown that the\noutward transport of energy by phonon conduction implies an inverse-square law\nof force at low speeds, and the full Schwarzschild metric at high speeds. A\nprediction of the new theory is that when two inertial observers move too fast\nrelative to each other, or when fields are too strong, anharmonic corrections\nwill modify effects like time dilation, and will lead to asymmetries which\nimplies that the FRP may not be sustainable in this extreme limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2000 17:03:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2000 17:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
