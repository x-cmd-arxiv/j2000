The high twin frequency nu_h in\nthis model holds the upper hybrid frequency relation to the rotational\nfrequency of the neutron star's magnetosphere Omega: nu_h^2=nu_K^2+\n4(Omega/2pi)^2. The vector Omega is assumed to have an angle delta with the\nnormal to the disk. The first oscillator in the TO model allows one to\ninterpret the horizontal branch observed below 100 Hz as the lower mode of the\nKeplerian oscillator under the influence of the Coriolis force, with frequency\nnu_L being dependent on nu_h, nu_K and delta. For some stars such as 4U\n0614+09, Sco X-1 and 4U 1702-42, nu_h, nu_K and nu_L have been observed\nsimultaneously providing the opportunity to check the central prediction of the\nTO model: the constancy of delta for a particular source. Given the\nconsiderable variation of each of these three frequencies, the existence of an\nobservational invariant with a clear physical interpretation as a global\nparameter of the neutron star magnetosphere is an important test of the TO\nmodel. Using the results of recent observations of 4U 0614+09 we verify the\nexistence of this invariant and determine the angle delta=15^o.6+/- 0.^o5 for\nthis star. The second oscillator in the model deals with a radial (presumably\nsound) oscillation and diffuse process in the viscous layer surrounding the\nneutron star. Our analysis of the viscous oscillation frequency nu_V and the\nbreak frequency nu_b of the diffusion shows that the spin value of the inner\nboundary of the transition layer for 4U 0614+09 is at least two times more than\nvalues for 4U 1728-34 and Sco X-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2000 19:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In the description\nof river network structure, scaling laws are uniformly observed. Reported\nvalues of scaling exponents vary suggesting that no unique set of scaling\nexponents exists. To improve this current understanding of scaling in river\nnetworks and to provide a fuller description of branching network structure, we\nreport here a theoretical and empirical study of fluctuations about and\ndeviations from scaling. We examine data for continent-scale river networks\nsuch as the Mississippi and the Amazon and draw inspiration from a simple model\nof directed, random networks. We center our investigations on the scaling of\nthe length of sub-basin's dominant stream with its area, a characterization of\nbasin shape known as Hack's law. We generalize this relationship to a joint\nprobability density and show that fluctuations about scaling are substantial.\nWe find strong deviations from scaling at small scales which can be explained\nby the existence of linear network structure. At intermediate scales, we find\nslow drifts in exponent values indicating that scaling is only approximately\nobeyed and that universality remains indeterminate. At large scales, we observe\na breakdown in scaling due to decreasing sample space and correlations with\noverall basin shape. The extent of approximate scaling is significantly\nrestricted by these deviations and will not be improved by increases in network\nresolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2000 19:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Specifically, an averaged view of network architecture is first\nprovided by a proposed self-similarity statement about the scaling of drainage\ndensity, a local measure of stream concentration. This scaling of drainage\ndensity is shown to imply Tokunaga's law, a description of the scaling of side\nbranch abundance along a given stream, as well as a scaling law for stream\nlengths. This establishes the scaling of the length scale associated with\ndrainage density as the basic signature of self-similarity in river networks.\nWe then consider fluctuations in drainage density and consequently the numbers\nof side branches.
