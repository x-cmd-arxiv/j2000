This implies a lack of information, hence a symmetry, as\nto where the particle will move. We here study the consequences for free\nparticles of spin 0 and spin 1/2. On a cubic spatial lattice a hopping equation\nis derived, and the continuum limit taken. Spin 0 leads to the Schroedinger\nequation, and spin 1/2 to the Weyl equation. Both Hamiltonians are hermitian\nautomatically, if time-reversal symmetry is assumed. Hopping amplitudes with a\n\"slight\" inhomogeneity lead to the Weyl equation in a metric-affine space-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2000 12:50:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Depending on the charge state Z of the ion the relation of\nstrength between laser field and ionic core changes. We find around Z=12\ntypical multiphoton dynamics and for Z=3 tunneling behaviour, however with\nclear relativistic signatures. In first order in v/c the magnetic field\ncomponent of the laser field induces a Z-dependent drift in the laser\npropagation direction and a substantial Z-dependent angular momentum with\nrepect to the ionic core. While spin oscillations occur already in first order\nin v/c as described by the Pauli equation, spin induced forces via spin orbit\ncoupling only appear in the parameter regime where (v/c)^2 corrections are\nsignificant. In this regime for Z=12 ions we show strong splittings of resonant\nspectral lines due to spin-orbit coupling and substantial corrections to the\nconventional Stark shift due to the relativistic mass shift while those to the\nDarwin term are shown to be small. For smaller charges or higher laser\nintensities, parts of the electronic wavepacket may tunnel through the\npotential barrier of the ionic core, and when recombining are shown to give\nrise to keV harmonics in the radiation spectrum. Some parts of the wavepacket\ndo not recombine after ionisation and we find very energetic electrons in the\nweakly relativistic regime of above threshold ionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2000 15:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
