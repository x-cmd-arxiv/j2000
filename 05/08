Surprisingly, this makes them very useful for\nconstraining models. I discuss what happens when one attempts to qualitatively\nfit the NLS1 phenomenon using the stellar wind model for AGN line emission\n(e.g., Kazanas 1989). The simplest way of narrowing profile bases of this model\nto the widths observed in NLS1s is probably to lower the mass of the\nsupermassive black hole. In a flux-limited and redshift-limited data set, this\nis indeed similar to increasing L/L_Edd. Because the broad line region (BLR) of\nthe stellar line emission model scales with the tidal radius of the stars, this\nmodel predicts maximal BLR velocities of FWZI proportional (L/L_Edd)^(-1/3).\nThis implies that the black holes of NLS1s are approximately 3^3=27 times less\nmassive than those in other Seyfert 1s if the stellar line emission model is\ncorrect. Another consequence of increasing L/L_Edd in this model is that it\nresults in an increase in the wind edge densities. NLS1 spectra appear to\nsupport this result as well. Even the collateral features of NLS1s, such as the\nline asymmetries and continuum properties, appear to be easily explained within\nthe context of this model.

We call it Witten's solution\nbecause according to the Witten conjecture the function F(x_1, x_2, x_3,...) =\nW(x_1,(x_2)/2, (x_3)/3,...) is the generating function for intersection nambers\nof Mumford-Morita-Muller cohomological classes of the moduli space of n-spin\nRiemann surfaces. This conjecture was proved by Kontsevich for n=2 and by\nWitten himself for surfaces of genus 0.\n  In this paper we find recurrence relations between coefficients of Taylor\nseries of W. This reduces the Witten's conjecture to conjecture that the\nMamford-Morita-Muller numbers satisfy to the same relations. These relations\ngive also an algorithm for calculation of $n$-spin Mamford-Morita-Muller\nnumbers in assuming that the Witten conjecture is true. Moreover we prove that\nF(x_1,x_2,...,x_{n-1},0,0,...)= W(x_1, (x_2)/2,...,(x_{n-1})/(n-1),0,0,...).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2000 13:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
