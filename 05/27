To improve the\nanalysis of experimental data and the quantitative comparison of theory with\nexperiment, we have developed a three-dimensional finite-difference code that\ncan integrate the three-dimensional Boussinesq equations (which govern the\nevolution of the temperature, velocity, and pressure fields associated with a\nconvecting flow) efficiently in large box-shaped domains with experimentally\nappropriate lateral boundary conditions. We discuss some details of this code\nand present two applications, one to the occurrence of quasiperiodic dynamics\nwith as many as 5 incommensurate frequencies in a moderate-aspect-ratio 10x5\nconvection cell, and one to the onset of spiral defect chaos in square cells\nwith aspect ratios varying from Gamma=16 to 56.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2000 19:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The full set of requirements\nthat must be met to make quantum computing a reality in the laboratory [1] is\ndaunting, involving capabilities well beyond the present state of the art. In\nthis report we develop a significant simplification of these requirements that\ncan be applied in many recent solid-state approaches, using quantum dots [2],\nand using donor-atom nuclear spins [3] or electron spins [4]. In these\napproaches, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable\nHeisenberg interaction (the Hamiltonian is $H_{ij}=J(t){\\vec S}_i\\cdot{\\vec\nS}_j$ between spins $i$ and $j$), while the one-qubit gates require the control\nof a local Zeeman field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit\noperations are significantly slower and require substantially greater materials\nand device complexity, which may also contribute to increasing the decoherence\nrate. Here we introduce an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction\nalone suffices to exactly implement any quantum computer circuit, at a price of\na factor of three in additional qubits and about a factor of ten in additional\ntwo-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the\ncomplexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards these\nsolid-state implementations of quantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2000 16:23:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 2002 19:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
