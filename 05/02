The similarity, in\nspite the differences in the physical parameters between the Galaxy and the\nSMC, suggests that the shape of the power spectra reflects some underlying\nmechanism which is not too sensitive to the environmental specifics. In this\npaper we present an interpretation for the observational power spectra in terms\nof a large scale turbulence in the interstellar medium, in which the emitting\nH$_I$ regions are embedded. The turbulence gives rise to density fluctuations\nwhich lead to the observed intensity fluctuations, in the H$_I$ regions. The\nobservational power spectra are used to deduce the turbulence spectral\nfunction.\n  In the SMC, the turbulence largest eddies are comparable in scale to the SMC\nitself. This implies that turbulent mixing should have smoothed out any large\nscale abundance gradients. Indeed, this seems to be the case, observationally.\n  The turbulence is also expected to amplify and shape up the large scale\nmagnetic field. Indeed, the observational data indicate the existence of a\nlarge scale disordered field of the strength expected from energy equilibrium\nwith the turbulent velocity field. The large scale turbulence is most probably\ngenerated by instabilities in the large scale flows induced by the tidal close\nencounter with the LMC $ \\sim 2\\times 10^8{\\rm yr}$ ago. The life-time of the\nlargest eddies is $\\sim 4\\times 10^8{\\rm yr}$ so the turbulence had not yet\nenough time to decay and persists even though the energy source is no longer\nthere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2000 16:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

A real-valued function on $K$ is said to\nbe of Baire class one (Baire-1) if it is the pointwise limit of a sequence of\ncontinuous functions. In this paper, we study two well known ordinal indices of\nBaire-1 functions, the oscillation index $\\beta$ and the convergence index\n$\\gamma$. It is shown that these two indices are fully compatible in the\nfollowing sense : a Baire-1 function $f$ satisfies $\\beta(f) \\leq\n\\omega^{\\xi_1} \\cdot \\omega^{\\xi_2}$ for some countable ordinals $\\xi_1$ and\n$\\xi_2$ if and only if there exists a sequence of Baire-1 functions $(f_n)$\nconverging to $f$ pointwise such that $\\sup_n\\beta(f_n) \\leq \\omega^{\\xi_1}$\nand $\\gamma((f_n)) \\leq \\omega^{\\xi_2}$. We also obtain an extension result for\nBaire-1 functions analogous to the Tietze Extension Theorem. Finally, it is\nshown that if $\\beta(f) \\leq \\omega^{\\xi_1}$ and $\\beta(g) \\leq\n\\omega^{\\xi_2},$ then $\\beta(fg) \\leq \\omega^{\\xi},$ where\n$\\xi=\\max\\{\\xi_1+\\xi_2, \\xi_2+\\xi_1}\\}.$ These results do not assume the\nboundedness of the functions involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2000 06:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
