It relies on the measurement of small\ncoherent distortions of the images of background galaxies. Even low-level\ncorrelations in the intrinsic shapes of galaxies could however produce a\nsignificant spurious lensing signal. These correlations are also interesting in\ntheir own right, since their detection would constrain models of galaxy\nformation. Using $3\\times 10^{4} - 10^5$ halos found in N-body simulations, we\ncompute the correlation functions of the intrinsic ellipticity of spiral\ngalaxies assuming that the disk is perpendicular to the angular momentum of the\ndark matter halo.

Mixing episodes on the RGB and\n  early-AGB","comments":"Accepted for publication in A&A (11 pages, 1 figure)","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"astro-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  We present a critical analysis of the nature of the so-called Li-rich RGB\nstars. For a majority of the stars, we have used Hipparcos parallaxes to\ndetermine masses and evolutionary states by comparing their position on the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Among the\ntwenty Li-rich giants whose location on the HR diagram we were able to\ndetermine precisely, eight should be re-classified as Li-normal. For the\nremaining stars, the high Li abundance must be a result of fresh synthesis of\nthis fragile element. We identify two distinct episodes of Li production which\noccur in advanced evolutionary phases depending upon the mass of the star. We\nsuggest that the Li-rich stars are formed mainly as a precursor to the deeper\nmixing process which produces anomalously low carbon isotopic ratios. Low-mass\nRGB stars, which later undergo the helium flash, produce Li at the phase\nreferred to as the bump in the luminosity function. In intermediate-mass stars,\nthe Li-rich phase occurs on the early-AGB. The compiled data provide\nconstraints on the time scales for extra mixing and some insight on processes\nsuggested in the literature. However, our results do not suggest any specific\ntrigger mechanism. Since the Li-rich phases are extremely short, enrichment of\nthe Li content of the ISM as a result of these episodes is negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2000 15:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we show that the formerly\nestablished fusion rules can be employed to develop a theory in which\nKolmogorov's statistics of 1941 acts as the zero order, or background\nstatistics, and the anomalous corrections to the K41 scaling exponents\n$\\zeta_n$ of the $n$th order structure functions can be computed analytically.\nThe crux of the method consists of renormalizing a 4-point interaction\namplitude on the basis of the fusion rules. The novelty is that this amplitude\nincludes a small dimensionless parameter, which is shown to be of the order of\nthe anomaly of $\\zeta_2$, $\\delta_2= \\zeta_2-2/3\\approx 0.03$. Higher order\ninteraction amplitudes are shown to be even smaller. The corrections to K41 to\n$O(\\delta_2)$ result from standard logarithmically divergent ladder-diagrams in\nwhich the 4-point interaction acts as a \"rung\". The theory allows a calculation\nof the anomalous exponents $\\zeta_n$ in powers of the small parameter\n$\\delta_2$. The $n$-dependence of the scaling exponents $\\zeta_n$ stems from\npure combinatorics of the ladder diagrams. We calculate the exponents $\\zeta_n$\nup to $O(\\delta_2^3)$. Previously derived bridge relations allow a calculation\nof the anomalous exponents of correlations of the dissipation field and of\ndynamical correlations in terms of the same parameter $\\delta_2$.
