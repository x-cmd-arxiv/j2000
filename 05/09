At\neach cluster position, the CMB temperature fluctuation will be a combination of\nthe Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) kinematic and thermal components, the cosmological\nfluctuations and the instrument noise term. When averaged over many such\nclusters the last three will integrate down, whereas the first one will be\ndominated by a possible bulk flow component.

The known\nresults for R-anomaly suggest that the total scale anomaly extrapolated to N=1\nshould be the same as the anomaly of a single free (2,0) tensor multiplet. A\nproposed explanation of this agreement is that the coefficient 4N^3 in the\nanomaly (which was found previously to be also the ratio of the 2-point and\n3-point graviton correlators in the (2,0) theory and in the free tensor\nmultiplet theory) is shifted to 4N^3 -3N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2000 22:54:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2000 20:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2000 16:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2005 14:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
