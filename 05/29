The measurement of zinc\nabundance in a DLA system at z_abs > 3 obtained by means of the UVES\nspectrograph at the VLT prompted us to re-analyse the full sample of zinc\nabundances present in the literature to search for a metallicity-redshift\nrelation in DLA systems. The study of the metallicities of individual systems\nshows evidence for an anti-correlation between [Zn/H] and redshift supported by\ndifferent types of statistical tools. The zinc metallicity decreases by -0.3\n+/- 0.1 dex per unit redshift interval in the range 0.5 <~ z_abs <~ 3.5.

The\n$<V/V_{\\rm max}>$ of the long bursts is $ 0.2901\\pm 0.0113$, and that of the\nshort bursts is $0.4178\\pm 0.0239$, which is a Euclidean value. For luminosity\nfunction models, we consider a cylindrical-beam and a conic-beam. We take into\naccount the spatial distribution of GRB sources as well. A broad luminosity\nfunction is naturally produced when one introduces beaming of GRBs. We\ncalculate the maximum detectable redshift of GRBs, $z_{\\rm max}$.

When the parent or\nboth solid phases are morphologically unstable, i.e., for a small temperature\ngradient/growth rate ratio ($G/v_p$), one solid phase usually outgrows and\ncovers the other phase, leading to a cellular-dendritic array structure closely\nanalogous to the one formed during monophase solidification of a dilute binary\nalloy. In contrast, when $G/v_p$ is large enough for both phases to be\nmorphologically stable, the formation of the microstructurebecomes controlled\nby a subtle interplay between the nucleation and growth of the two solid\nphases. The structures that have been observed in this regime (in small samples\nwhere convection effect are suppressed) include alternate layers (bands) of the\nparent and peritectic phases perpendicular to the growth direction, which are\nformed by alternate nucleation and lateral spreading of one phase onto the\nother as proposed in a recent model [R.
