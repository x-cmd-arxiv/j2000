The recent strong claim by Mook et al., if true further supports\nour intuition.

Experiment is currently unable to identify these mesons, but we\nreport here on a lattice QCD calculation which confirms that the OZI rule\narises from QCD in the vector and axial vector mesons as observed, and finds a\nlarge violation of the rule in the scalar mesons as anticipated by the quark\nmodel.

We studied\nthe temporal structure of single unit (SU) activity and simultaneously recorded\nlocal field potential (LFP) activity from area LIP in the inferior parietal\nlobe of two awake macaques during a memory-saccade task. Using multitaper\ntechniques for spectral analysis, which play an important role in obtaining the\npresent results, we find elevations in spectral power in a 50--90 Hz (gamma)\nfrequency band during the memory period in both SU and LFP activity. The\nactivity is tuned to the direction of the saccade providing evidence for\ntemporal structure that codes for movement plans during working memory. We also\nfind SU and LFP activity are coherent during the memory period in the 50--90 Hz\ngamma band and no consistent relation is present during simple fixation.\nFinally, we find organized LFP activity in a 15--25 Hz frequency band that may\nbe related to movement execution and preparatory aspects of the task. Neuronal\nactivity could be used to control a neural prosthesis but SU activity can be\nhard to isolate with cortical implants. As the LFP is easier to acquire than SU\nactivity, our finding of rich temporal structure in LFP activity related to\nmovement planning and execution may accelerate the development of this medical\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2000 05:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
