A series of seven spatially\noffset long-slit spectra spaced by 0.07'' were obtained along the axis of the\noutflow to build up a 3-D intensity-velocity ``cube'' in various forbidden\nemission lines (FELs) and Ha. Here we present high spatial resolution synthetic\nline images close to the star in distinct radial velocity intervals (from ~ +50\nkm/s to ~ -450 km/s in four bins, each ~ 125 km/s wide). The lowest velocity\nemission is also examined in finer detail (from +60 km/s to -70 km/s in five\nbins ~ 25 km/s wide). We have found that the highest velocity and most highly\ncollimated component, i.e. the jet, can be traced from DG Tau to a distance D ~\n0.7''. The jet is on the axis of a pear-shaped limb-brightened bubble which\nextends between 0.4'' and 1.5'' from the source and which we interpret as a bow\nshock. Other condensations are seen close to the star indicating ongoing\ntemporal variations in the flow. The low-velocity component of the outflow is\nfound to be spatially wide close to the source (~ 0.2'' at D=0.2''), in\ncontrast to the high velocity jet (width <~ 0.1''). We have also found evidence\nto suggest that the density increases longitudinally with proximity to the\nsource and also laterally towards the flow axis. Thus, at least in the case of\nDG Tau, the flow becomes gradually denser as it increases in velocity and\nbecomes more collimated. Our observations show a continous bracketing of the\nhigher speed central flow within the lower speed, less collimated, broader\nflow, down to the lowest velocity scales. This suggests that the low and high\nvelocity FELs in the highly active T Tauri star DG Tau are intimately related.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 May 2000 18:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Domain walls of this type have\ninfinite tension, while usual kink type of solutions interpolating between two\nAdS minima have finite tension. Non-singular domain walls with infinite tension\nmight a priori avoid recent ``no-go'' theorems indicating impossibility of\nsupersymmetric embedding of kink type of domain walls in gauged supergravity.\nWe argue that (non-singular) domain walls are stable even if they have infinite\ntension. This is essentially due to the fact that localization of gravity in\nsmooth domain walls is a Higgs mechanism corresponding to a spontaneous\nbreakdown of translational invariance. We point out that if the scalar\npotential has no minima and approaches finite negative values at infinity, then\nhigher derivative terms are under control, and do not affect the cosmological\nconstant on the brane which is vanishing for such backgrounds. Nonetheless, we\nalso point out that higher curvature terms generically delocalize gravity, so\nthat the desired lower dimensional Newton's law is no longer reproduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2000 09:17:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2000 17:27:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2000 08:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2000 01:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this case, the dynamics\nis characterized by two time scales. First, an equilibrium is reached on a fast\ntime scale within the degenerated subspaces of the system. Then, an equilibrium\nbetween these subspaces is reached on a slow time scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2000 13:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
