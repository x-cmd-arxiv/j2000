The Universe then entered a ``dark age'' which persisted until\nthe first cosmic structures collapsed into gravitationally-bound systems, and\nevolved into stars, galaxies, and black holes that lit up the Universe again.\nSome time between redshift of 7 and 15, stars within protogalaxies created the\nfirst heavy elements; these systems, together perhaps with an early population\nof quasars, generated the ultraviolet radiation that reheated and reionized the\ncosmos. The history of the Universe during and soon after these crucial\nformative stages is recorded in the all-pervading intergalactic medium (IGM),\nwhich is believed to contain most of the ordinary baryonic material left over\nfrom the Big Bang. Throughout the epoch of structure formation, the IGM becomes\nclumpy and acquires peculiar motions under the influence of gravity, and acts\nas a source for the gas that gets accreted, cools, and forms stars within\ngalaxies, and as a sink for the metal enriched material, energy, and radiation\nwhich they eject.

Near-onset behavior of this shallow fluidized bed was described\nin the earlier paper (Tsimring et al, 1999). Above the threshold of\nfluidization the system exhibits a Hopf bifurcation as the layer starts to\noscillate at a certain frequency due to a feedback between the layer dilation\nand the airflow drag force. After application of temporal band-pass filtering\nof this frequency we discovered the spatio-temporal dynamics in the form of\ndefect turbulence. This type of dynamics is natural for spatio-temporal systems\nclose to the threshold of a Hopf bifurcation. At high flow rates, low-frequency\nshort-wavelength structures appear in addition to the long-wavelength\nexcitations. A simple model describing the instability and occurrence of\noscillations in a shallow fluidized bed, is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2000 02:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We argue that this concept is incompatible with the force laws of\naction-at-a-distance electrodynamics, and we suggest that the trajectory of a\nparticle (the world-line) should be looked upon as a string in static\nequilibrium. By complementing our model with a time symmetric interaction law,\nwe are led to a straightforward derivation of the principles underlying the\nelectromagnetic interaction between two uniformly moving charged particles. An\nextension of our theory to the case of particles in arbitrary motion shows that\nwe have to modify Maxwell's equations of the microscopic electromagnetic field,\nin order to accommodate a field-strength tensor which is no longer\nantisymmetric. It is further argued that the radiation reaction force gives\nanother example of a 4-force which is not orthogonal to the 4-velocity, thus\nleading to a variable rest mass. The variation of the rest mass is then\ndiscussed from the point of view of the equivalence principle of general\nrelativity, and we end up with a theoretical derivation of the homogenous\nMaxwell's equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2000 01:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}
