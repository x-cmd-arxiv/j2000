The source is assumed to be a static point\nsource located on an arbitrary position above the disc, on or off the axis of\nrotation.

Because of the gravitational\nlensing effect, an enhancement of the iron line is expected when the primary\nsource is located close to the central black hole.

This is an\nexperimentally challenging task, given the required detector mass for\nlong-baseline experiments. We address the benefit of a high-granularity,\nexcellent-calorimetry non-magnetized target-detector, which provides a\nbackground-free identification of electron neutrino charged current and a\nkinematical selection of tau neutrino charged current interactions. We assume\nthat charge discrimination is only available for muons reaching an external\nmagnetized-Fe spectrometer. This allows the clean classification of events into\nelectron, right-sign muon, wrong-sign muon and no-lepton categories. In\naddition, high granularity permits a clean detection of quasi-elastic events,\nwhich by detecting the final state proton, provide a selection of the neutrino\nelectron helicity without the need of an electron charge measurement. From\nquantitative analyses of neutrino oscillation scenarios, we conclude that in\nmany cases the discovery sensitivities and the measurements of the oscillation\nparameters are dominated by the ability to measure the muon charge.

We show that, provided the correct chiral behaviour of\nQCD is respected in the extrapolation to realistic quark masses, one can indeed\nobtain a fairly reliable determination of the sigma commutator using present\nlattice data. For two-flavour dynamical fermion QCD the sigma commutator lies\nbetween 45 and 55 MeV based on recent data from CP-PACS and UKQCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2000 06:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}
