Using a large homogeneous sample of 45\nlow-metallicity H II regions in BCGs, and extrapolating the Y-O/H and Y-N/H\nlinear regressions to O/H = N/H = 0, we obtain Yp = 0.2443+/-0.0015, in\nexcellent agreement with the weighted mean value Yp = 0.2452+/-0.0015 obtained\nfrom the detailed analysis of the two most metal-deficient BCGs known, I Zw 18\nand SBS 0335-052. The derived slope dY/dZ = 2.4+/-1.0 is in agreement with the\nvalue derived for the Milky Way and with simple chemical evolution models with\nhomogeneous outflows. Adopting Yp = 0.2452+/-0.0015 leads to a baryon-to-photon\nratio of (4.7+/-1.0)x10^{-10} and to a baryon mass fraction in the Universe\nOmega_b h^2_{50} = 0.068+/-0.015, consistent with the value derived from the\nprimordial D abundance of Burles & Tytler (1998).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2000 11:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We study the evolution of the phase structure in temperature\nand chemical potential with variations of the strength of the interaction in\nthe quark-quark channel and demonstrate that the phase diagram can realize a\ntotal of six different topologies. A vector interaction representing\nsingle-gluon exchange reproduces a topology commonly encountered in previous\nQCD models, in which a low-density chiral broken phase is separated from a\nhigh-density diquark phase by a first-order line. The other five topologies\neither do not possess a diquark phase or display a new phase and new critical\npoints. Since these five cases require large variations of the coupling\nconstants away from the values expected for a vector interaction, we conclude\nthat the phase diagram of finite density QCD has the topology suggested by\nsingle-gluon exchange and that this topology is robust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2000 17:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

We not only derive the standard matrix treatment of spin\naddition - we discover a more generalized form of the theory. We apply the new\ngeneralized theory to the singlet and triplet states arising from the addition\nof the spins of two systems of spin 1/2 each. We obtain new generalized forms\nof the vectors and operators for these cases, and show that they reduce to the\nstandard forms in the appropriate limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2000 16:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To have the insight of the many-body\nteleportation, we introduce the measure of correlation information and study\nthe transfer of the correlation information and entanglement.
