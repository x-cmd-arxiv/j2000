The advantage of the K-band is a decreased sensitivity to\nreddening, and perhaps also a reduced systematic dependence on metallicity. In\norder to investigate the latter, and also to refer our calibration to a known\nmetallicity zero-point, we restrict our sample of red clump calibrators to\nthose with abundances derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data. The mean\nmetallicity of the sample is [Fe/H] = -0.18 dex. The data are consistent with\nno correlation between M_K and [Fe/H], and only weakly constrain the slope of\nthis relation. The luminosity function of the sample peaks at M_K = -1.61 +-\n0.03 mag. Next, we assemble published optical and near-infrared photometry for\nabout 20 red clump giants in a Baade's Window field with a mean metallicity\nnearly identical to that of the Hipparcos red clump. We derive the distance to\nthe Galactic center: R = 8.24 +- 0.42 kpc. The uncertainty in this distance\nmeasurement is dominated by the small number of Baade's Window red clump giants\nexamined here [abridged].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2000 16:09:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This formulation has the advantage that it immediately yields\nthe evolution equations in a hyperbolic form, which is not the case for the\nEinstein field equations in their original form. We show that the perturbation\nequations can always be written in terms of spacetime variables only,\nregardless of any particular gauge. We demonstrate how to obtain the\nRegge-Wheeler gauge, by choosing appropriate lapse and shift. In addition, not\nonly the 3-metric but also the extrinsic curvature of the initial slice have to\nsatisfy certain conditions in order to preserve the Regge-Wheeler gauge\nthroughout the evolution. We discuss various forms of the equations and show\ntheir relation to the formulation of Allen et al. New results are presented for\npolytropic equations of state. An interesting phenomenon occurs in very compact\nstars, where the first ring-down phase in the wave signal corresponds to the\nfirst quasinormal mode of an equal mass black hole, rather than to one of the\nproper quasinormal modes of the stellar model. A somewhat heuristic explanation\nto account for this phenomenon is given. For realistic equations of state, the\nnumerical evolutions exhibit an instability, which does not occur for\npolytropic equations of state. We show that this instability is related to the\nbehavior of the sound speed at the neutron drip point. As a remedy, we devise a\ntransformation of the radial coordinate $r$ inside the star, which removes this\ninstability and yields stable evolutions for any chosen numerical resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2000 18:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2001 15:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A natural generalization of the case of the torus leads to\nconstruct a projective unitary representation of pi_1(\\Sigma), realized on the\nHilbert space of square integrable functions on the upper half--plane. A\nuniquely determined gauge connection, which in turn defines a gauged sl_2(R)\nalgebra, provides the central extension. This has a geometric interpretation as\nthe gauge length of a geodesic triangle, and corresponds to a 2-cocycle of the\n2nd Hochschild cohomology group of the Fuchsian group uniformizing Sigma. Our\nconstruction can be seen as a suitable double-scaling limit N\\to\\infty,\nk\\to-\\infty of a U(N) representation of pi_1(Sigma), where k is the degree of\nthe associated holomorphic vector bundle, which can be seen as the higher-genus\nanalog of 't Hooft's clock and shift matrices of QCD. We compare the above\nmentioned uniqueness of the connection with the one considered in the\ndifferential-geometric approach to the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem provided by\nDonaldson.

In the auxiliary-field\nmethod, the L-slice approximant to the density matrix can be evaluated as a\nfunction of inverse temperature at any finite L as\n$\\rho_L(\\beta)=[\\rho_1(\\beta/L)]^L$, if the density matrix $\\rho_1(\\beta)$ in\nthe static approximation is known. We investigate the convergence of the\npartition function $Z_L(\\beta)=Tr\\rho_L(\\beta)$, the internal energy and the\ndensity of states $g_L(E)$ (the inverse Laplace transform of $Z_L$), as\n$L\\to\\infty$. For the simple harmonic oscillator, $g_L(E)$ is a normalized\ntruncated Fourier series for the exact density of states. When the\nauxiliary-field approach is applied to spin systems, approximants to the\ndensity of states and heat capacity can be negative. Approximants to the\ndensity matrix for a spin-1/2 dimer are found in closed form for all L by\nappending a self-interaction to the divergent Gaussian integral and\nanalytically continuing to zero self-interaction. Because of this continuation,\nthe coefficient of the singlet projector in the approximate density matrix can\nbe negative. For a spin dimer, $Z_L$ is an even function of the coupling\nconstant for L<3: ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling can be\ndistinguished only for $L\\ge 3$, where a Berry phase appears in the functional\nintegral. At any non-zero temperature, the exact partition function is\nrecovered as $L\\to\\infty$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2000 19:52:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
