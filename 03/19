The X-ray flux of the sources ranges\nbetween 1.5 and 25 x 10-14 cgs, the lower value being 3 times fainter than in\nprevious BeppoSAX and ASCA surveys. Their R band magnitudes are in the range\n12.8-22. Six of the Chandra sources are broad line quasars with redshifts\nbetween 0.42 and 1.19, while the optical identification of the remaining four\nis quite varied: two are X-ray obscured, emission line AGN at z=0.272 and\nz=0.683, one is a starburst galaxy at z=0.016 and one, most unusually, is an\napparently normal galaxy at z=0.158. These findings confirm and extend down to\nfainter X-ray fluxes the BeppoSAX results, in providing samples with a wide\nrange of X-ray and optical properties. The ratio between the soft X-ray and the\noptical luminosity of the z=0.158 galaxy is a factor at least 30 higher than\nthat of normal galaxies, and similar to those of AGN. The high X-ray luminosity\nand the lack of optical emission lines suggest an AGN in which either continuum\nbeaming dominates, or emission lines are obscured or not efficiently produced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2000 16:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

First, the expanded-stretched chains in low\nmonovalent salt solutions collapse into nearly neutral compact structures when\nthe density of multivalent salt approaches that of the monomers. With further\naddition of multivalent salt the chains redissolve acquiring expanded-coiled\nconformations. We study the redissolution transition using a two state model\n[F. Solis and M. Olvera de la Cruz, {\\it J. Chem. Phys.} {\\bf 112} (2000)\n2030]. The redissolution occurs when there is a high degree of screening of the\nelectrostatic interactions between monomers, thus reducing the energy of the\nexpanded state. The transition is determined by the chemical potential of the\nmultivalent ions in the solution $\\mu$ and the inverse screening length\n$\\kappa$. The transition point also depends on the charge distribution along\nthe chain but is almost independent of the molecular weight and degree of\nflexibility of the polyelectrolytes. We generate a diagram of $\\mu$ versus\n$\\kappa^2$ where we find two regions of expanded conformations, one with\ncharged chains and other with overcharged (inverted charge) chains, separated\nby a collapsed nearly neutral conformation region. The collapse and\nredissolution transitions occur when the trajectory of the properties of the\nsalt crosses the boundaries between these regions. We find that in most cases\nthe redissolution occurs within the same expanded branch from which the chain\nprecipitates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2000 18:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
