Radiative corrections to one gluon exchange were previously considered\nand found to affect T_C. In particular, the quark self-energy in a plasma leads\nto non-Fermi liquid behaviour and suppresses T_C.

Nevertheless, as we demonstrate, there is in fact no\ncontradiction with the BRST identity, at least to leading log order.

A simple rule allowing to compare perturbative\npredictions of canonical and non-canonical theories is given. The notion of a\nunique vacuum state is replaced by a set of different vacua. Multi-photon\nstates are defined in the standard way but depend on the choice of vacuum.\nMaking a simplified choice of the vacuum state we estimate corrections to\natomic lifetimes, probabilities of multiphoton spontaneous and stimulated\nemission, and the Planck law.

Given the\n`quantum logical' constraints that are typically adopted by such\ninterpretations, only certain sets of variables can be taken to be\nsimultaneously definite-valued, and only certain sets of values can be ascribed\nto these variables at a given time. Moreover, each allowable set of variables\nand values can be uniquely specified by a single `preferred' projector in the\nHilbert space associated with the system. In general, the preferred projector\ncan be one of several possibilities at a given time. In previous modal\ninterpretations, the different possible preferred projectors have formed an\northogonal set. This paper investigates the consequences of adopting a\nnon-orthogonal set. We present three contributions on this issue: (1) we\nprovide an argument for such non-orthogonality, based on the assumption that\nperfectly predictable measurements reveal pre-existing values of variables, an\nassumption which has traditionally constituted a strong motivation for the\nmodal approach; (2) we generalize the existing framework for modal\ninterpretations to accommodate non-orthogonal preferred projectors; (3) we\npresent a novel type of modal interpretation wherein the set of preferred\nprojectors is fixed by a principle of entropy minimization, and we discuss some\nof the successes and shortcomings of this proposal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2000 01:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The simple formalism of surface modes is briefly\npresented which allows the possibility to obtain the generalization of Lifshitz\nresults for the case of two semi-spaces covered by the thin layers. Additional\nclarifications of the regularization procedure provides the means to obtain\nreliable results not only for the force but also for the energy density. This,\nin turn, leads to the value of the force for the configuration of a sphere\n(lens) above a plate both of which are covered by additional layers. The\nCasimir interaction between Al and Au test bodies is recalculated using the\noptical tabulated data for the complex refractive index of these metals. The\ncomputations turn out to be in agreement with the perturbation theory up to the\nfourth order in relative penetration depth of electromagnetic zero point\noscillations into the metal. The disagreements between the results recently\npresented in the literature are resolved. The Casimir force between Al bodies\ncovered by the thin Au layers is computed and the possibility to neglect\nspatial dispersion effects is discussed as a function the layer thickness. The\nvan der Waals force is calculated including the transition region to the\nCasimir force. The pure non-retarded van der Waals force law between Al and Au\nbodies is shown to be restricted to a very narrow distance interval from 0.5 nm\nto (2--4) nm. New, more exact, values of the Hamaker constant for Al and Au are\ndetermined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2000 01:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
