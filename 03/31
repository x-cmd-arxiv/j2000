The formal integration of the transfer\nequation is performed by a generalization of the short characteristics (SC)\nmethod to spherical coordinates. Accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) and Ng's\nalgorithm are used to converge towards a solution. By taking a logarithmically\nspaced radial coordinate grid, the method has the natural capability of\ntreating problems that span several decades in radius, in the most extreme case\nfrom the stellar radius up to parsec scale. Flux conservation is guaranteed in\nspherical coordinates by a particular choice of discrete photon directions and\na special treatment of nearly-radially outward propagating radiation. The\nalgorithm works well from zero up to very high optical depth, and can be used\nfor a wide variety of transfer problems, including non-LTE line formation, dust\ncontinuum transfer and high temperature processes such as compton scattering.\nIn this paper we focus on multiple scattering off dust grains and on non-LTE\ntransfer in molecular and atomic lines. Line transfer is treated according to\nan ALI scheme for multi-level atoms/molecules, and includes both random and\nsystematic velocity fields. The algorithms are implemented in a multi-purpose\nuser-friendly radiative transfer program named RADICAL. We present two example\ncomputations: one of dust scattering in the Egg Nebula, and one of non-LTE line\nformation in rotational transitions of HCO$^{+}$ in a flattened protostellar\ncollapsing cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2000 16:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nmechanical property of long dsDNA molecules is then studied based on this\nmodel, where the base-stacking interactions between DNA adjacent nucleotide\nbasepairs, the steric effects of basepairs, and the electrostatic interactions\nalong DNA backbones are taken into account. Quantitative results are obtained\nby using path integral method, and excellent agreement between theory and the\nobservations reported by five major experimental groups are attained. The\nstrong intensity of the base-stacking interactions ensures the structural\nstability of DNA, while the short-ranged nature of such interactions makes\nexternally-stimulated large structural fluctuations possible. The entropic\nelasticity, highly extensibility, and supercoiling property of DNA are all\nclosely related to this account.

Such genetic regulation usually consists of interacting\nnetworks, whereby gene products from a single network can act to control their\nown expression or the production of protein in another network. Engineered\ncontrol of cellular function through the design and manipulation of such\nnetworks lies within the constraints of current technology. Here we develop a\nmodel describing the regulation of gene expression, and elucidate the effects\nof noise on the formulation. We consider a single network derived from\nbacteriophage $\\lambda$, and construct a two-parameter deterministic model\ndescribing the temporal evolution of the concentration of $\\lambda$ repressor\nprotein. Bistability in the steady-state protein concentration arises\nnaturally, and we show how the bistable regime is enhanced with the addition of\nthe first operator site in the promotor region. We then show how additive and\nmultiplicative external noise can be used to regulate expression. In the\nadditive case, we demonstrate the utility of such control through the\nconstruction of a protein switch, whereby protein production is turned ``on''\nand ``off'' using short noise pulses. In the multiplicative case, we show that\nsmall deviations in the transcription rate can lead to large fluctuations in\nthe production of protein, and describe how these fluctuations can be used to\namplify protein production significantly. These novel results suggest that an\nexternal noise source could be used as a switch and/or amplifier for gene\nexpression. Such a development could have important implications for gene\ntherapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2000 19:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

By noticing that equations and instruments make contact\nin a CPC, we rewrite equations of quantum mechanics to explicitly include\nfunctions of CPC-commands to the instruments. This sets up a proof that a\nscientist's choice in linking mathematical models to instruments is\nunresolvable without guesswork to narrow the set of models from which one is to\nbe chosen.\n  As for implications of the proof, scientists inherit choices from the past\nand frame choices for the future, choices open to guesswork and visible in CPC\nfiles. To picture these choices, we adapt colored Petri nets, and the\navailability of these net fragments makes choice and guesswork part and parcel\nof physics.\n  Net fragments as a means of expressing guess-demanding choices are applied to\nportray guesswork needed in testing and calibrating a quantum computer.
