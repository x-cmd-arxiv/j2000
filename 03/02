Charge\ninversion in one atom (handedness or chirality) generates a switch from\natom-atom to atom-antiatom systems. this switch reduces the 10 term Hamiltonian\nfor 4-particle systems to only 1 or 2 terms. This reduced parity adapted\nHamiltonian accounts for observed PECs for atom-atom systems (results for 9\nbonds are given). Hydrogen-antihydrogen reactions, feasible in the near future,\nwill produce a normal H(2) molecule, which would solve the problem about the\nexistence of anti-matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2000 14:34:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2000 10:18:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2000 12:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The working fluid of the engine is composed of an\nensemble of noninteracting two level systems. External work is applied by\nchanging the external field and thus the internal energy levels. The friction\ninduces a minimal cycle time. The power output of the engine is optimized with\nrespect to time allocation between the contact time with the hot and cold baths\nas well as the adiabats. The engine's performance is also optimized with\nrespect to the external fields. By reversing the cycle of operation a heat pump\nis constructed. The performance of the engine as a heat pump is also optimized.\nBy varying the time allocation between the adiabats and the contact time with\nthe reservoir a universal behavior can be identified. The optimal performance\nof the engine when the cold bath is approaching absolute zero is studied. It is\nfound that the optimal cooling rate converges linearly to zero when the\ntemperature approaches absolute zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2000 12:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

A task example is considered in which a quantum robot searches a\nspace region to find the location of a system. The possibility that the search\ncan be more efficient than a classical search is examined by considering use of\nGrover's Algorithm to process the search results. For reversible searches this\nis problematic for two reasons. One is the removal of entanglements generated\nby the search process. The other is that even if the entanglement can be\navoided, the search process in 2-D space regions is no more efficient than a\nclassical search. However, quantum searches of space regions with 3 or more\ndimensions are more efficient than classical searches.
