The design of the instrument is driven by the goal of maximizing\nobserving efficiency, especially for observations of faint, extragalactic\nobjects. Thus, FIFI LS utilizes an integral field technique that uses slicer\nmirrors to optically re-arrange the two-dimensional field into a single slit\nfor a long slit spectrometer. Effectively, a 5x5 pixel spatial field of view is\nimaged to a 25x1 pixel slit and dispersed to a 25x16 pixel, two-dimensional\ndetector array, providing diffraction-limited spatial and spectral\nmultiplexing. In this manner, the instrument employs two parallel, medium\nresolution (R~2000) grating spectrometers for simultaneous observations in two\nbands: a short wavelength band (42 to 110 micron) and a long wavelength band\n(110 to 210 micron). Overall, for each of the 25 spatial pixels, the instrument\ncan cover a velocity range of ~1500 km/s around selected far-infrared lines\nwith an estimated sensitivity of 2x10^-15 W Hz^1/2 per pixel.
