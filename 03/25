Our simple Boltzmann equation model serves as an analogy for\nunmagnetized fluid disks in which turbulence may be driven by thermal\nconvection. We show that interparticle collisions in particle disks play the\nsame role as fluctuating pressure forces and viscous dissipation in turbulent\ndisks: both transfer energy in random motions associated with one direction to\nthose associated with another, and convert kinetic energy into heat. The\ndirection of angular momentum transport in stirred particle and fluid disks is\ndetermined by the direction of external stirring and by the properties of the\ncollision term in the Boltzmann equation (or its analogue in the fluid\nproblem). In particular, our model problem yields inward transport for\nvertically or radially stirred disks, provided collisions are suitably\ninelastic; the transport is outwards in the elastic limit. Numerical\nsimulations of hydrodynamic turbulence driven by thermal convection find inward\ntransport; this requires that fluctuating pressure forces do little to no work,\nand is analogous to an externally stirred particle disk in which collisions are\nhighly inelastic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2000 21:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2000 17:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We have investigated two models\nwith different density of states energy dependencies with our method. In\ngeneral, we have found that the motion of a packet in energy space is affected\nby two competing tendencies. First, there is a packet broadening, i.e. the\ndispersive energy transport. Second, there is a narrowing of the packet, if the\ndensity of states is depleting with decreasing energy. It is the interplay of\nthese two tendencies that determines the overall evolution. If the density of\nstates is constant, only broadening exists. In this case a packet in energy\nspace evolves into Gaussian one, moving with constant drift velocity and mean\nsquare deviation increasing linearly in time. If the density of states depletes\nexponentially with decreasing energy, the motion of the packet tremendously\nslows down with time. For large times the mean square deviation of the packet\nbecomes constant, so that the motion of the packet is ``soliton-like''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2000 22:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

To this end we explain first how one can\ncompute on constraint satisfaction problems using rules represented by simple\nfirst-order formulas. Then we consider constraint satisfaction problems that\nare based on predefined, explicitly given constraints. To solve them we first\nderive rules from these explicitly given constraints and limit the computation\nprocess to a repeated application of these rules, combined with labeling.We\nconsider here two types of rules. The first type, that we call equality rules,\nleads to a new notion of local consistency, called {\\em rule consistency} that\nturns out to be weaker than arc consistency for constraints of arbitrary arity\n(called hyper-arc consistency in \\cite{MS98b}). For Boolean constraints rule\nconsistency coincides with the closure under the well-known propagation rules\nfor Boolean constraints. The second type of rules, that we call membership\nrules, yields a rule-based characterization of arc consistency. To show\nfeasibility of this rule-based approach to constraint programming we show how\nboth types of rules can be automatically generated, as {\\tt CHR} rules of\n\\cite{fruhwirth-constraint-95}.
