This\nenables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of a homogeneous\nsample of nearby UV-selected starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-IR\nto UV luminosities, the ratio of Halpha to Hbeta luminosities, the Halpha\nequivalent width, and the UV spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime\nof stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient to resolve an apparent discrepancy\nbetween the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In\naddition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to\nlambda^-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-IR to UV\nluminosities and the UV spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply\nas a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow\nwavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the\nsteepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In\nparticular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical\ndepths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation\nof all the observations. Our model for absorption can be incorporated easily\ninto any population synthesis model.

In this paper I will motivate the general\nrelativistic version of this formula, and thereby arrive at a geometrically\nnatural definition of an `invariant quasilocal energy', or IQE. In analogy with\nthe invariant mass m, the IQE is invariant under local boosts of the set of\nobservers on a given two-surface S in spacetime. A reference energy subtraction\nprocedure is required, but in contrast to the Brown-York procedure, S is\nisometrically embedded into a four-dimensional reference spacetime. This\nvirtually eliminates the embeddability problem inherent in the use of a\nthree-dimensional reference space, but introduces a new one: such embeddings\nare not unique, leading to an ambiguity in the reference IQE. However, in this\ncodimension-two setting there are two curvatures associated with S: the\ncurvatures of its tangent and normal bundles. Taking advantage of this fact, I\nwill suggest a possible way to resolve the embedding ambiguity, which at the\nsame time will be seen to incorporate angular momentum into the energy at the\nquasilocal level. I will analyze the IQE in the following cases: both the\nspatial and future null infinity limits of a large sphere in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes; a small sphere shrinking toward a point along either spatial\nor null directions; and finally, in asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes.\nThe last case reveals a striking similarity between the reference IQE and a\ncertain counterterm energy recently proposed in the context of the conjectured\nAdS/CFT correspondence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2000 21:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

One example is known in five\nspacetime dimensions, within the toroidal compactification of type IIB string\ntheory. Such special solution is allowed by the existence of a Chern-Simons\ncoupling in the Supergravity theory and by the possibility of imposing a self\nduality condition on the `rotation 2-form'. We explore three peculiar features\nof such black holes: 1) Oxidising to D=10 the five dimensional configuration\nmay be interpreted as a system of $D1-D5$ branes with a Brinkmann wave\npropagating along their worldvolume. Unlike its five dimensional Kaluza-Klein\ncompactification, the universal covering space of this manifold has no\ncausality violations. In other words, causal anomalies can be solved in higher\ndimensions. From the dual SCFT viewpoint, the causality bound for the\ncompactified spacetime arises as the unitarity bound; 2) The vanishing of the\nscattering cross section for uncharged scalars and sufficiently high angular\nmomentum of the background is shown still to hold at the level of charged\ninteractions. The same is verified when a non-minimal coupling to the geometry\nis used. Therefore, the `repulson' behaviour previously found is universal for\nnon accelerated observers; 3) The solutions are shown to have a non-standard\ngyromagnetic ratio of $g=3$. In contrast, the superpartners of a static, BPS,\nfive dimensional black hole have $g=1$. At the semi-classical level, we find\nthat a Dirac fermion propagating in the rotating hole background has $g=2\\pm1$,\ndepending on the spinor direction of the fermion being parallel to Killing or\n`anti-Killing' spinors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2000 19:56:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2000 09:14:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2000 18:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

DR\nis closely related to transition radiation (TR), which is produced when a\ncharged particle traverses the boundary between media with different dielectric\nconstants. In contrast to TR, which is now extensively used for beam diagnostic\npurposes, the potential of DR as a non-interceptive, multi-parameter beam\ndiagnostic remains largely undeveloped. For diagnostic measurements it is\nuseful to observe backward reflected DR from an circular aperture or slit\ninclined with respect to the beam velocity. However, up to now, well founded\nequations for the spectral-angular intensities of backward DR from such\napertures have not been available. We present a new derivation of the spectral\nangular intensity of backward DR produced from an inclined slit for two\norientations of the slit axis, i.e. perpendicular and parallel to the plane of\nincidence. Our mathematical approach is generally applicable to any geometry\nand simpler than the Wiener Hofp method previously used to calculate DR from\nsingle knife edges. Our results for the slit are applied to the measurement of\northogonal beam size and divergence components. We discuss the problem of\nseparating the simultaneous effects of these beam parameters on the angular\ndistribution of DR and provide solutions to this difficulty.
