A correlation between Gamma and optical\nH-beta was also found for the radio-quiet quasars in this sample, whereby the\nsteepest X-ray spectra tend to be found in those objects with narrow H-beta\nwidths. The correlation is significant at >99% confidence, confirming the\nwell-known trend between Gamma and H-beta FWHM in Seyfert 1s (Brandt et al.\n1997), but at higher luminosities. Other spectral complexities are observed\nfrom this sample. A soft X-ray excess, with blackbody temperatures in the range\n100 - 300 eV, is seen in many low z radio-quiet quasars. In most cases the\ntemperatures are probably too hot to originate directly from the disk. Iron K\nline emission features are also found in the RQQs; but often from partially\nionised material. Indeed in the highest luminosity RQQs there is neither\nevidence for iron line emission nor the reflection component expected from disk\nmodels. These observations can be explained by an increase in the quasar\naccretion rate with luminosity, leading to an increase in the ionisation state\nof the surface layers of the disk. The occurrence of ionised or `warm'\nabsorbers is rare in this sample, with only 5 detections. However excess\nneutral X-ray absorption is found towards several of the high z, predominantly\nradio-loud, quasars. Although found to increase with quasar redshift, this\n`intrinsic' absorption may be associated with radio-loud AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2000 20:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is found that the order of the\nphase transition to a kaon-condensed phase, and whether or not Gibbs' rules for\nphase equilibrium can be satisfied in the case of a first order transition,\ndepend sensitively on the choice of the kaon-nucleon interaction. The main\neffect of finite temperature, for any value of the lepton fraction, is to mute\nthe effects of a first order transition, so that the thermodynamics becomes\nsimilar to that of a second order transition. Above a critical temperature,\nfound to be at least 30--60 MeV depending upon the interaction, the first order\ntransition disappears. The phase boundaries in baryon density versus lepton\nnumber and baryon density versus temperature planes are delineated. We find\nthat the thermal effects on the maximum gravitational mass of neutron stars are\nas important as the effects of trapped neutrinos, in contrast to previously\nstudied cases in which the matter contained only nucleons or in which hyperons\nand/or quark matter were considered. Kaon-condensed EOSs permit the existence\nof metastable neutron stars, because the maximum mass of an initially hot,\nlepton-rich protoneutron star is greater than that of a cold, deleptonized\nneutron star. The large thermal effects imply that a metastable protoneutron\nstar's collapse to a black hole could occur much later than in previously\nstudied cases that allow metastable configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2000 21:34:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2000 15:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
