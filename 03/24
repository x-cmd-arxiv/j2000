Most of them rely on\nconcepts of elementary particle physics, like phase transitions in the early\nUniverse, string theory and processes during the inflationary epoch. Here we\npresent some more astrophysical arguments to provide some guidance through this\nlarge number and variety of models. Especially the fact that the evolution of\nmagnetic fields depends on the spatial coherence scale of the fields leds to\nsome interesting conclusions, which may rule out the majority of the\ntheoretical scenarios. In principle one has to distinguish between the\nlarge-scale and small-scale magnetic fields. Large scale fields are defined as\nthose as becoming sub-horizon at that redshift at which the mass energy density\nbecomes equal to the photon energy density, which we name as equality. Small\nscale fields which are sub-horizon even before equality, i.e. with scales lower\nthan (present) few Mpc cannot survive the radiation era and cannot reach\nrecombination, because of the effects of magnetic diffusion and photon\ndiffusion. Therefore mechanisms based on phase transitions become unlike, as\nthey provide magnetic fields on scales smaller than the horizon. Thus, the\nobserved galactic and intergalactic fields, which are small scales in our\nterminology must be created after recombination by normal plasma processes\nduring the protogalactic evolution. The large scale fields instead were\nproduced during inflation and may have noticeable implications for the\nformation of the large scale structure of the Universe. The inclusion of large\nscale magnetic fields may improve present Cold Dark Matter theories of\nstructure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2000 08:20:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2000 09:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this model, the\nsupergravity (SUGRA) and gauge mediated (GM) contributions to MSSM scalar and\ngaugino masses are comparable - this enables a realistic spectrum to be\nattained since GM contribution to the right-handed (RH) slepton (mass)^2 by\nitself (i.e., neglecting SUGRA contribution to sfermion {\\em and} gaugino\nmasses) is negative.

With MSSM matter and SUSY breaking\nfields localized on separate branes in an extra dimension of size R \\sim 5\nM^{-1}_{Pl} (in which gauge fields propagate), the SUGRA contribution to\nsfermion masses (which violates flavor) is suppressed. As in 4 dimensions, MSSM\ngauginos acquire {\\em non}-universal masses from both SUGRA and GM - gaugino\nmasses (in particular the SUGRA contribution to gaugino masses), in turn,\ngenerate acceptable sfermion masses through RG evolution; the phenomenology is\ndiscussed briefly. We also point out that a) in models where SUSY is broken by\na GUT non-singlet field, there is, in general, a contribution to MSSM gaugino\n(and scalar) masses from the coupling to heavy gauge multiplet which {\\em\nmight} be {\\em comparable} to the SUGRA contribution and b) models of GM\nproposed earlier which also have negative RH slepton (mass)^2 can be rendered\nviable using the \\tilde{g}MSB idea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2000 23:05:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2000 22:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2000 23:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The temperature dependence of $F$ strongly suggests that a reduced\nnumber of degrees of freedom contributes to the free energy in the non-planar\nsector, $F_{\\rm np}$, at high temperature. This phenomenon seems generic,\nindependent of the UV sensitivity, and can be traced to modes whose thermal\nwavelengths become smaller than the noncommutativity scale. The temperature\ndependence of $F_{\\rm np}$ can then be calculated at high temperature using\nclassical statistical mechanics, without encountering a UV catastrophe even in\nlarge number of dimensions. This result is a telltale sign of the low number of\ndegrees of freedom contributing to $F$ in the non-planar sector at high\ntemperature.

We give a\ngeneral procedure to map these deformed algebras to appropriate Lie algebras.\nThis is used, for the non compact cases, to obtain the annihilation operator\ncoherent states, by finding the canonical conjugates of these operators.\n  Generalized coherent states, in the Perelomov sense also follow from this\nconstruction. This allows us to explicitly construct coherent states associated\nwith various quantum optical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2000 10:53:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
