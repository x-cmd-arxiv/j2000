This outer protoplanet may get captured into the 2:3\nresonance with the more massive one, in which case the gaps that the two\nplanets open in the disc overlap. Two effects arise, namely a squared mass\nweighted torque imbalance and an increased mass flow through the overlapping\ngaps from the outer disc to the inner disc, which both play in favour of an\noutwards migration. Indeed under the conditions presented here, which describe\nthe evolution of a pair of protoplanets respectively Jupiter and Saturn sized,\nthe migration is reversed, while the planets semi-major axis ratio is constant\nand the eccentricities are confined to small values by the disc material.

It is based on the Gutzwiller\napproximation which gives the renormalization of parameters, t and J, due to\nthe Gutzwiller's projection operator excluding the double occupancies. The\nfinite-range correlations are taken into account compared with the conventional\nGutzwiller approximation where only the on-site expectation values are\nconsidered. It is shown that the essential point of the renormalization is its\nnonlinear dependence on the expectation values of Cooper pairs and\nantiferromagnetic moment. In particular the renormalization factor of J becomes\nanisotropic in the presence of antiferromagnetic moment, i.e., that for the\nz-component is enhanced compared with that for the xy-component.

Only by applying a suitable\nnon-constant external body force, and for very specific boundary conditions on\nthe flow, can these quantities be kept finite. This problem is ameliorated in\nmore realistic models of the fluid. For instance, adding viscosity always makes\nthe Hawking flux finite, but greatly complicates the behaviour of the acoustic\nradiation --- viscosity is tantamount to explicitly breaking ``acoustic Lorentz\ninvariance''. Thus, this issue represents both a difficulty and an opportunity\n--- acoustic horizons may be somewhat more difficult to form than naively\nenvisaged, but if formed, they may be much easier to detect than one would at\nfirst suppose.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2000 22:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2000 21:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

System-level\ngenetic codes differ from part-level genetic codes in which each discrete part\nis coded independently. In general, a system-level genetic code requires coding\ndiscrete interacting parts such as organs or proteins in an interdependent way.\nChanging a single symbol or \"gene\" in a system-level genetic code affects two\nor more parts in a coordinated way. System-level genetic codes provide a\nplausible mechanism for evolution by leaps also known as systemic\nmacromutations or hopeful monsters without invoking an intelligent agent,\nvitalistic forces, or new laws of physics. A system-level genetic code may\nexplain the rapid appearance of new forms of life in the fossil record such as\nthe Cambrian Explosion in which most invertebrate phyla appeared.

We generate our\nmultimode-beamsplitter potential with two current-carrying wires on a glass\nsubstrate combined with an external transverse bias field. The atoms bend\naround several curves over a $10$-cm distance. A maximum integrated flux of\n$1.5\\cdot10^{5} \\mathrm{atoms/s}$ is achieved with a current density of\n$5\\cdot10^{4} \\mathrm{Ampere/cm^{2}}$ in the 100-$\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ diameter\nwires. The initial beam can be split into two beams with a 50/50 splitting\nratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2000 23:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
