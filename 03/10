The objective was to find and study more examples of\nan unusual phenomenon found for one of the velocity components of H2 in the\nspectrum of zeta Ori by Jenkins & Peimbert (1997). Specifically, they detected\na gradual shift in velocity and broadening for features arising from\nprogressively higher rotational excitations J. This effect appears to be absent\nin the spectra of both delta and epsilon Ori, which are only a few degrees away\nin the sky from zeta Ori. The absence of atomic material at a large negative\nvelocity in the spectra of delta and epsilon Ori (and its presence in zeta Ori)\nsupports a proposal by Jenkins & Peimbert that the line of sight to zeta\nintercepts a bow shock facing away from us, perhaps created by the collision of\nwind-like material with some foreground obstruction. For both stars, the H2\nabsorption features are separated into two velocity components. Total H2 column\ndensities toward delta and epsilon Ori are 5.5e14 and 1.9e16 cm^-2,\nrespectively. The rotation temperatures of the molecules with J > 2 toward\nepsilon Ori indicate that the gas is in the general vicinity of the stars that\nemit UV fluxes capable of rotationally pumping the molecules. For the strongest\ncomponent of H2 toward delta Ori, the pumping rate is lower and consistent with\na general UV flux level in the plane of the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2000 16:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We present the source counts, galaxy sizes and\nisophotal filling factors of the HDF-South images. The observed integrated\ngalaxy counts reach >500 galaxies per square arcminute at AB<30.

The trend previously\nseen that fainter galaxies are smaller, continues to AB=29 in the high\nresolution HDF-S STIS image, where galaxies have a typical half-light radius of\n0.1 arcseconds. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that the small measured\nsizes are not due to selection effects until >29mag. Using the HDF-S NICMOS\nimage, we show that galaxies are smaller in the near infrared than they are in\nthe optical. We analyze the isophotal filling factor of the HDF-S STIS image,\nand show that this image is mostly empty sky even at the limits of galaxy\ndetection, a conclusion we expect to hold true for NGST spectroscopy. At the\nsurface brightness limits expected for NGST imaging, however, about a quarter\nof the sky is occupied by the outer isophotes of AB<30 galaxies. We discuss the\nimplications of these data on several design concepts of the NGST near-infrared\nspectrograph. We compare the effects of resolution and the confusion limit of\nvarious designs, as well as the multiplexing advantages of either multi-object\nor full-field spectroscopy.

We\nsuggest that the variation of the carbon mass fraction $X$(C) in the C+O WD (or\nthe variation of the initial WD mass) causes the diversity of the brightness of\nSNe Ia. This model can explain the observed dependences of SNe Ia brightness on\nthe galaxy types and the distance from the galactic center.\n  Finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of SN Ia\nprogenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as a\ncomposite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2000 17:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Two ways have been explored to resolve these problems: loop checking\nand tabling. Loop checking can cut infinite loops, but it cannot be both sound\nand complete even for function-free logic programs. Tabling seems to be an\neffective way to resolve infinite loops and redundant computations. However,\nexisting tabulated resolutions, such as OLDT-resolution, SLG- resolution, and\nTabulated SLS-resolution, are non-linear because they rely on the\nsolution-lookup mode in formulating tabling. The principal disadvantage of\nnon-linear resolutions is that they cannot be implemented using a simple\nstack-based memory structure like that in Prolog. Moreover, some strictly\nsequential operators such as cuts may not be handled as easily as in Prolog.\n  In this paper, we propose a hybrid method to resolve infinite loops and\nredundant computations. We combine the ideas of loop checking and tabling to\nestablish a linear tabulated resolution called TP-resolution. TP-resolution has\ntwo distinctive features: (1) It makes linear tabulated derivations in the same\nway as Prolog except that infinite loops are broken and redundant computations\nare reduced. It handles cuts as effectively as Prolog. (2) It is sound and\ncomplete for positive logic programs with the bounded-term-size property.

However in the holographic effective theory the\nessentially 4D radion dominates at long distances and gives rise to scalar\nanti-gravity. The holographic description shows that at large distances the GRS\nmodel is equivalent to the model recently proposed by Dvali, Gabadadze and\nPorrati (DGP), where a tensionless brane is embedded into 5D Minkowski space,\nwith an additional induced 4D Einstein-Hilbert term on the brane. In the\nholographic description the radion of the GRS model is automatically localized\non the tensionless brane, and provides the ghost-like field necessary to cancel\nthe extra graviton polarization of the DGP model. Thus, there is a holographic\nduality between these theories.

We\ndemonstrate analytically that, even for vanishing pair momentum, the cross\nterms $R_{ol}^2$ and $R_{sl}^2$ of the HBT correlation function in general show\na strong first harmonic in their azimuthal dependence. The strength of this\noscillation characterizes the tilt of the major axis of the spatial emission\nellipsoid away from the direction of the beam. Event generator studies indicate\nthat this tilt can be large (>20 degrees) at AGS energies which makes it by far\nthe most significant azimuthally sensitive HBT signal at these energies.\nMoreover, transport models suggest that for pions this spatial tilt is directed\nopposite to the tilt of the directed flow ellipsoid in momentum space. A\nmeasurement of the azimuthal dependence of the HBT cross terms $R_{ol}^2$ and\n$R_{sl}^2$ thus probes directly the physical origin of directed pion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2000 13:19:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2000 19:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

The periodic table is derived from dualities of string\ntheory and a Kaluza-Klein substructure for the six extra spatial dimensions. As\na molecule is the composite of atoms with chemical bonds, a hadron is the\ncomposite of elementary particles with hadronic bonds. The masses of elementary\nparticles and hadrons can be calculated using the periodic table with only four\nknown constants: the number of the extra spatial dimensions in the superstring,\nthe mass of electron, the mass of Z=B0, and the fine structure constant for the\nmagnetic field. The calculated masses are in good agreement with the observed\nvalues. For examples, the calculated masses for the top quark, neutron, and\npion are 176.5 GeV, 939.54MeV, and 135.01MeV in excellent agreement with the\nobserved masses, 176 =B1 13 GeV, 939.57 MeV, and 134.98 MeV, respectively. The\nmasses of 110 hadrons are calculated. The overall average difference between\nthe calculated masses and the observed masses for all hadrons is 0.29 MeV. The\nperiodic table of elementary particles provides the most comprehensive\nexplanation and calculation for the masses of elementary particles and hadrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2000 22:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
