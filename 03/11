The X-ray light curve shows a very rapid flare\nin which the 2-10 keV flux increased by ~60% in <200 seconds. This rapid rise\nis followed by a drop-off in the 2-10 keV flux of ~40% in <600 seconds. The\n10-15 keV variation in this flare is roughly a factor of two on similar\ntime-scales. During the rise of the flare, the 3-15 keV spectral index hardened\nfrom 2.02 +/- 0.03 to 1.87 +/- 0.04, where it remained during the decay of the\nflare. This is the fastest variation ever seen in X-rays from Mrk 501 and among\nthe fastest seen at any wavelength for this object. The shift in the energy at\nwhich the spectral power peaks (from <3 keV before the flare to >30 keV during\nthe flare) is also among the most rapid shifts seen from this object. This\nflare occurs during an emission state (2-10 keV flux approximately 1.2e-10 erg\ncm^-2 s^-1) that is approximately 25% of the peak flux observed in 1997 April\nfrom this object but which is still high compared to its historical average\nX-ray flux. The variations in the hardness ratio are consistent with the low\nenergy variations leading those at high energies during the development and\ndecay of the flare. This pattern is rare among high frequency peaked BL Lac\nobjects like Mrk 501, but has been seen recently in two other TeV emitting BL\nLacs, Mrk 421 and PKS 2155-304. The hard lag is consistent with a flare\ndominated by the acceleration time-scale for a simple relativistic shock model\nof flaring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2000 19:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
