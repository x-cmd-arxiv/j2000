We find that the bulk\nLorentz factors required by the spread in the observed luminosities in all\nbands are significantly smaller than those implied by other, both observational\nand theoretical, considerations. This discrepancy is also reflected in the fact\nthat FR I nuclei are over-luminous by a factor of 10-10^4, with respect to the\npredictions, both in the radio and in the optical band.\n  In order to reconcile these results with the unification scheme, velocity\nstructures in the jet are suggested, where a fast spine is surrounded by a slow\n(but still relativistic) layer so that the emission at different angles is\ndominated by different velocity components: the fast one dominates the emission\nin BL Lacs while the slow layer dominates the emission in misaligned objects.\nFurthermore for the lowest luminosity BL Lacs it has to be also postulated that\ntheir beaming factor in the radio band is lower than in the optical (and\nX-ray), as would result from deceleration of the jet.\n  The self-consistency of the unification model therefore requires that both\nintrinsic differences in the SED and different beaming properties play a\nsubstantial role in characterizing the phenomenology of these sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2000 16:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this Letter, we focus on some\nstatistical properties of these counts which are fundamental in order to\ncharacterize the large scale correlations in the galaxy spatial distribution.\nThere are, in fact, no longer doubts since two decades of the existence of very\nlarge scale structures. The still remaining problem concerns the correct\ncharacterization of their statistical properties. We propose to study two\nproperties of galaxy counts data, in order to discriminate between a small\nscale (~ 5 - 20 Mpc/h) homogeneous distribution, and a fractal structure on\nlarge scales (~ 20 - 300 Mpc/h). Firstly, the average slope of the counts which\ncan be associated to an eventual fractal dimension in real space by simple\narguments. Secondly, we propose to study fluctuations of counts around the\naverage behavior as a function of apparent magnitude in the whole magnitude\nrange B_j > 11. These fluctuations can discriminate between a genuine fractal\ndistribution and a homogeneous one. In fact, they are related to the very\nstatistical properties of the spatial distribution, independently on\ncosmological corrections. More specifically, in a fractal distribution one\nexpects to find persistent scale-invariant fluctuations around the average\nbehavior, which do not decay with apparent magnitude. On the other hand, in an\nhomogeneous distribution, on large enough scales, the relative variance of the\ncounts should decrease exponentially with apparent magnitude. Smooth\ncosmological corrections cannot change such a behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2000 15:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Given such specifications, it is natural to\nconsider proving properties about the specified systems in the framework: for\nexample, given the specification of evaluation for a functional programming\nlanguage, prove that the language is deterministic or that evaluation preserves\ntypes. One challenge in developing a framework for such reasoning is that\nhigher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), an elegant and declarative treatment of\nobject-level abstraction and substitution, is difficult to treat in proofs\ninvolving induction. In this paper, we present a meta-logic that can be used to\nreason about judgments coded using HOAS; this meta-logic is an extension of a\nsimple intuitionistic logic that admits higher-order quantification over simply\ntyped lambda-terms (key ingredients for HOAS) as well as induction and a notion\nof definition. We explore the difficulties of formal meta-theoretic analysis of\nHOAS encodings by considering encodings of intuitionistic and linear logics,\nand formally derive the admissibility of cut for important subsets of these\nlogics. We then propose an approach to avoid the apparent tradeoff between the\nbenefits of higher-order abstract syntax and the ability to analyze the\nresulting encodings. We illustrate this approach through examples involving the\nsimple functional and imperative programming languages PCF and PCF:=. We\nformally derive such properties as unicity of typing, subject reduction,\ndeterminacy of evaluation, and the equivalence of transition semantics and\nnatural semantics presentations of evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2000 22:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2001 17:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This region is affected both by\nnon-perturbative phenomena related to the Fermi motion of the heavy quark and\nby perturbative soft gluon radiation in the final state (Sudakov form\nfactor).Fermi motion can be described by the shape function f (m*), which\nrepresents the distribution of the effective mass m* of the heavy quark at\ndisintegration time. We perform a factorization with a simple technique in\norder to consistently separate perturbative from non-perturbative effects. We\nfind that the shape function, contrary to naive expectations,is not a physical\ndistribution, as it is affected by substantial regularization scheme effects,\ncontrolling even the leading, double-logarithmic term. It factorizes, however,\nthe bulk of non-perturbative effects in lattice-like regularizations. Some\nnon-perturbative effects are present in the coefficient function even at\nleading twist, but they are expected to be suppressed on physical grounds.\nFinally, we clarify a controversial factor of 2 in the evolution kernel of the\nshape function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2000 11:48:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2000 11:24:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2000 22:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We extend our local\nholomorphic dimension formula and prove an analogue of the index theorem in the\nQuantum Field Theory context. The analytic index is the Jones index, more\nprecisely the minimal dimension, and, on a 4-dimensional spacetime, the DHR\ntheorem gives the integrality of the index. We introduce the notion of\nholomorphic dimension; the geometric dimension is then defined as the part of\nthe holomorphic dimension which is symmetric under charge conjugation. We apply\nthe AHKT theory of chemical potential and we extend it to the low dimensional\ncase, by using conformal field theory. Concerning Quantum Field Theory on\ncurved spacetime, the geometry of the manifold enters in the expression for the\ndimension. If a quantum black hole is described by a spacetime with bifurcate\nKilling horizon and sectors are localizable on the horizon, the logarithm of\nthe holomorphic dimension is proportional to the incremental free energy, due\nto the addition of the charge, and to the inverse temperature, hence to the\nsurface gravity in the Hartle-Hawking KMS state. For this analysis we consider\na conformal net obtained by restricting the field to the horizon\n(``holography''). Compared with our previous work on Rindler spacetime, this\nresult differs inasmuch as it concerns true black hole spacetimes, like the\nSchwarzschild-Kruskal manifold, and pertains to the entropy of the black hole\nitself, rather than of the outside system. An outlook concerns a possible\nrelation with supersymmetry and noncommutative geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2000 18:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2005 17:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-06"}
