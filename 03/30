Our model consists\nof an elastic filament pair connected by active elements. We derive the dynamic\nequations for this system in presence of internal forces. In the limit of small\ndeformations, a perturbative approach allows us to calculate filament shapes\nand the tension profile. We demonstrate that periodic filament motion can be\ngenerated via a self-organization of elastic filaments and molecular motors.\nOscillatory motion and the propagation of bending waves can occur for an\ninitially non-moving state via an instability termed Hopf bifurcation. Close to\nthis instability, the behavior of the system is shown to be independent of\nmicroscopic details of the axoneme and the force-generating mechanism. The\noscillation frequency however does depend on properties of the molecular\nmotors. We calculate the oscillation frequency at the bifurcation point and\nshow that a large frequency range is accessible by varying the axonemal length\nbetween 1 and 50$\\mu$m. We calculate the velocity of swimming of a flagellum\nand discuss the effects of boundary conditions and externally applied forces on\nthe axonemal oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2000 10:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
