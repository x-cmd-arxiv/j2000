We use a variational Hartree-Fock-like approximation to analyze\nthe effects of layer separation, layer density, tunneling, and applied gate\nvoltages on the layer densities and on interlayer phase coherence. In agreement\nwith earlier work, we find that for very small layer separations and low layer\ndensities, an interlayer-correlated ground state possessing spontaneous\ninterlayer coherence (SILC) is obtained, even in the absence of interlayer\ntunneling. In contrast to earlier work, we find that as a function of total\ndensity, there exist four, rather than three, distinct noncrystalline phases\nfor balanced double-layer systems without interlayer tunneling. The newly\nidentified phase exists for a narrow range of densities and has three\ncomponents and slightly unequal layer densities, with one layer being spin\npolarized, and the other unpolarized. An additional two-component phase is also\npossible in the presence of sufficiently strong bias or tunneling.

The algebra of time-dependent Bose-operators is\nelaborated and the normal-ordering theorem for them is formulated. It is\nestablished that the spectral region where the quadrature fluctuations are\nweaker than the shot-noise, depends on both the relaxation time of the\nnonlinearity and the magnitude of the nonlinear phase shift. It is also shown\nthat the frequency at which suppression of the fluctuation is greatest can be\ncontrolled by adjusting the phase of the initial coherent light pulse. The\nspectral correlation function of photons is introduced and photon antibunching\nis found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2000 10:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2000 11:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We study this phenomenon for different\ninitial preparations of the two-level atom. We then proceed to investigate the\ndecoherence originating from the interaction of the two-level atom with a lossy\ncavity mode. The loss mechanism is described in terms of a microscopic model\nthat couples the cavity mode to a bath of harmonic field modes. A suitably\ntuned external cw-laser field applied to the two-level atom slows down\nconsiderably the decoherence of the atom. We demonstrate the suppression of\ndecoherence for two opposite initial preparations of the atomic state: a\nquantum superposition state as well as the ground state. These findings can be\nused to the effect of a proficient battling of decoherence in qubit\nmanipulation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2000 11:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2000 11:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
