Inspired by the\nrecent observation that the stripes tilt away from the main axis of the crystal\nlattice in the regime x = 1/8, we propose that a new type of stripe phase is\nrealized in the large doping regime. This new phase should be viewed as a doped\nversion of the microscopically insulating x = 1/8 stripes. The topological\nexcitations associated with the extra doping are fractionally charged kinks\nalong the stripes whose motions make the stripe fluctuate. We argue that the\ndirectional degree of freedom of the kinks might order, causing the stripe\nphase to tilt. Quantitative predictions follow for the doping dependence of the\ntilt angle, which in turn can be used to determine the fundamental charge\nquantum associated with the stripe phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2000 15:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Interactions among\nfields can then be included consistently with the underlying gauge symmetries.\nThrough this process a relation between Dirac's work in 1936 on conformal\nsymmetry in field theory and the more recent worldline formulation of two-time\nphysics is established while providing a worldline gauge symmetry basis for the\nfield equations in d+2 dimensions. It is shown that the field theory formalism\ngoes well beyond Dirac's goal of linearizing conformal symmetry. In accord with\nrecent results in the worldline approach of two-time physics, the d+2 field\ntheory can be brought down to diverse d dimensional field theories by solving\nthe subset of field equations that correspond to the ``kinematic'' constraints.\nThis process embeds the one ``time'' in d-dimensions in different ways inside\nthe d+2 dimensional spacetime. Thus, the two-time d+2 field theory appears as a\nmore fundamental theory from which many one-time d dimensional field theories\nare derived. It is suggested that the hidden symmetries and relations among\ncomputed quantities in certain d-dimensional interacting field theories can be\ntaken as the evidence for the presence of a higher unifying structure in a d+2\ndimensional spacetime.

This aspect of the\ninterferometer can be translated into six-parameter representations of the\nLorentz group, as in the case of polarization optics where there are two\northogonal components of one light beam. It is shown that there are groups of\ntransformations which leave the coherency or density matrix invariant, and this\nsymmetry property is formulated within the framework of Wigner's little groups.\nAn additional mathematical apparatus is needed for the transition from a pure\nstate to an impure state. Decoherence matrices are constructed for this\nprocess, and their properties are studied in detail. Experimental tests of this\nsymmetry property are possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2000 22:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
