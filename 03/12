We describe an algorithm that allows branch-and-bound\nproblems to be solved in such environments. In designing this algorithm, we\nfaced two challenges: (1) scalability, to effectively exploit the variably\nsized pools of resources available, and (2) fault tolerance, to ensure the\nreliability of services. We achieve scalability through a fully decentralized\nalgorithm, by using a membership protocol for managing dynamically available\nresources. However, this fully decentralized design makes achieving reliability\neven more challenging. We guarantee fault tolerance in the sense that the loss\nof up to all but one resource will not affect the quality of the solution. For\npropagating information efficiently, we use epidemic communication for both the\nmembership protocol and the fault-tolerance mechanism. We have developed a\nsimulation framework that allows us to evaluate design alternatives.
