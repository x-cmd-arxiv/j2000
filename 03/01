Our detection is based on an initial imaging study of 14\nseparated 8' x 16' fields observed in good, homogeneous conditions with the\nprime focus EEV CCD camera of the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope. We detect an\nrms shear of 1.6% in 8' x 8' cells, with a significance of 3.4 sigma.

We\nalso verify our detection by computing the cross-correlation between the shear\nin adjacent cells. Including (gaussian) cosmic variance, we measure the shear\nvariance to be (0.016)^2 plus/minus (0.012)^2 plus/minus (0.006)^2, where these\n1 sigma errors correspond to statistical and systematic uncertainties,\nrespectively.

Standard Cassegrain designs for\nradiotelescope optics exhibit focal surface curvature so large that detectors\ncannot be placed more than 25 beam diameters from the central ray. The problem\nis worse for Ritchey-Cretien designs, because these minimize coma while\nincreasing field curvature. Classical aberrations, including coma, are usually\ndominated by diffraction in submillimeter-wave single dish telescopes. The\ntelescope designer must consider (1) diffraction, (2) aberration, (3) curvature\nof field, (4) cross-polarization, (5) internal reflections, (6) the effect of\nblockages, (7) means of beam chopping on- and off-source, (8) gravitational and\nthermal deformations of the primary mirror, (9) the physical mounting of large\ndetector packages, and (10) the effect of gravity and (11) vibration on those\ndetectors. Simultaneous optimization of these considerations in the case of\nlarge detector arrays leads to telescopes that differ considerably from\nstandard radiotelescope designs. Offset optics provide flexibility for mounting\ndetectors, while eliminating blockage and internal reflections.

A basic design decision was to aim at quickly obtaining\nhigh-quality schedules for realistically sized problems while maintaining human\ncontrol. The interaction between the decision maker and the algorithm therefore\nconsists in four steps: (1) choosing a set of lengths of work blocks (a work\nblock is a sequence of consecutive days of work shifts), (2) choosing a\nparticular sequence of work and days-off blocks among those that have optimal\nweekend characteristics, (3) enumerating possible shift sequences for the\nchosen work blocks subject to shift change constraints and bounds on sequences\nof shifts, and (4) assignment of shift sequences to work blocks while\nfulfilling the staffing requirements. The combination of constraint\nsatisfaction and problem-oriented intelligent backtracking algorithms in each\nof the four steps allows to find good solutions for real-world problems in\nacceptable time.

A discussion of how to assess the\nstatistical significance of features in these measures is included. In\naddition, new work is presented which builds on the framework established in\nthe review section. This work investigates how the estimates and their error\nbars are modified by finite sample sizes. Finite sample corrections are derived\nbased on a doubly stochastic inhomogeneous Poisson process model in which the\nrate functions are drawn from a low variance Gaussian process. It is found\nthat, in contrast to continuous processes, the variance of the estimators\ncannot be reduced by smoothing beyond a scale which is set by the number of\npoint events in the interval. Alternatively, the degrees of freedom of the\nestimators can be thought of as bounded from above by the expected number of\npoint events in the interval. Further new work describing and illustrating a\nmethod for detecting the presence of a line in a point process spectrum is also\npresented, corresponding to the detection of a periodic modulation of the\nunderlying rate. This work demonstrates that a known statistical test,\napplicable to continuous processes, applies, with little modification, to point\nprocess spectra, and is of utility in studying a point process driven by a\ncontinuous stimulus. While the material discussed is of general applicability\nto point processes attention will be confined to sequences of neuronal action\npotentials (spike trains) which were the motivation for this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Feb 2000 22:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The system is seeded with a\nlinearly executed ancestor capable only of reproducing its own genome, whereas\nits underlying language has the capacity for multiple threads of execution\n(i.e., simultaneous expression of sections of the genome.) We witness the\nevolution to multi-threaded organisms and track the development of distinct\nexpression patterns. Additionally, we examine both the evolvability of\nmulti-threaded organisms and the level of thread differentiation as a function\nof environmental complexity, and find that differentiation is more pronounced\nin complex environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Feb 2000 23:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such BIVACUUM, is an\ninfinitive source of Bivacuum fermions (BVF) and Bivacuum bosons (BVB). They\nmay assemble by 'head-to tail' principle the closed or open Virtual\nmicrotubules (VirMT) and Virtual Guides (VirG) of spin, momentum and energy.\nThe VirG represent quasi-1D Bose condensate and connect remote coherent\nelementary particles. The bundles of VirG composing 3D net in space, provide\nthe superfluid and nonlocal fraction of Bivacuum. The proposed Dynamic Model of\nCorpuscle [C]-Wave [W] duality interrelates the internal (hidden) parameters of\nsub-elementary fermions and their external, observable ones. The fusion of\nsub-elementary fermions to triplets at their symmetry shift determined by\nGolden mean conditions produce electrons, protons and neutrons. The different\nkind of Bivacuum matrix perturbation and excitation, accompanied [C-W]\npulsation of elementary fermions and their fast rotation, are responsible for\nelectrostatic, magnetic and gravitational fields excitation. The pace of time\nfor any closed system is shown to be determined by pace of internal kinetic\nenergy change of this system. Our relativistic formula for time contains beside\nthe velocity also the acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2000 05:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2005 09:56:23 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2005 11:37:51 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2005 12:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2005 18:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Mon, 8 May 2006 20:48:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2000 10:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2000 11:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2000 12:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2004 20:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2004 20:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2005 17:56:07 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 3 May 2005 15:53:29 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 16 May 2005 10:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
