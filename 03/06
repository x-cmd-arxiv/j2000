They are products of\nexplosive nucleosynthesis and neutrino emission. In the collapsar model, it is\nnatural to consider that the product of explosive nucleosynthesis depends on\nthe zenith angle because the system becomes highly asymmetric in order to\ngenerate a fire ball. We also consider the detectability of the HNRs which is\nlocated nearby our Galaxy. As a result, the number of the HNRs is estimated to\nbe 5 $\\times$ ($10^2$ -- $10^{-3}$), whose chemical composition can be\nspatially resolved. Using the optimistic estimate, more HNRs will be found and\nit will be possible to discuss on the chemical composition statistically. As\nfor the energy spectrums of neutrinos, they are not thermalized in a collapsar\nbecause the density of the accretion disk is much lower than that of a neutron\nstar. The energy spectrums of (anti-)electron neutrinos from hypernovae will be\nmainly determined by the process of electron (positron) capture on free proton\n(neutron). It is also noted that high energy tail is not dumped in the case of\nhypernovae because the density of emitting region is low. Total energy of\nneutrino from hypernovae will depend on a lot of physical parameters such as\ntotal accreting mass and mass accretion rate, which are quite contrary to the\nsituation of the normal collapse-driven supernovae. Therefore there will be a\nlarge variety of total neutrino's energies among collapsars.
