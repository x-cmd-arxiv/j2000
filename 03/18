Since\nthe DWT representation has strong capability of suppressing the off-diagonal\ncomponents of the covariance for selfsimilar clustering, the DWT covariance for\npopular models of the cold dark matter cosmogony generally is diagonal, or\n$j$(scale)-diagonal in the scale range, in which the second scale-scale\ncorrelations are weak. In this range, the DWT covariance gives a lossless\nestimation of the power spectrum, which is equal to the corresponding Fourier\npower spectrum banded with a logarithmical scaling. In the scale range, in\nwhich the scale-scale correlation is significant, the accuracy of a power\nspectrum detection depends on the scale-scale or band-band correlations. This\nis, for a precision measurements of the power spectrum, a measurement of the\nscale-scale or band-band correlations is needed. We show that the DWT\ncovariance can be employed to measuring both the band-power spectrum and second\norder scale-scale correlation. We also present the DWT algorithm of the binning\nand Poisson sampling with real observational data. We show that the alias\neffect appeared in usual binning schemes can exactly be eliminated by the DWT\nbinning. Since Poisson process possesses diagonal covariance in the DWT\nrepresentation, the Poisson sampling and selection effects on the power\nspectrum and second order scale-scale correlation detection are suppressed into\nminimum. Moreover, the effect of the non-Gaussian features of the Poisson\nsampling can be calculated in this frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2000 16:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The linearly polarized intensity P\n(with polarized brightness temperature going up to 10K) shows a `cloudy'\nstructure, with characteristic scales of 15'-30', which contains relatively\nlong, but very narrow `canals' (essentially unresolved) in which P is only a\nsmall fraction of that in the neighbouring beams.\n  These `canals' are generally seen in more than one frequency band, although\ntheir appearance changes between bands. They are probably due to depolarization\nwithin the synthesized beam, because the change in polarization angle across\nthe deepest `canals' is in general close to 90 degrees (or 270 etc.). These\nvery abrupt changes in polarization angle, which are seen only across the\n`canals', seem to be accompanied by abrupt changes in the Rotation Measure\n(RM), which may have the right magnitude to create the difference of close to\n90 degrees in polarization angle, and thereby the `canals'.\n  The structure in the polarization maps is most likely due to Faraday rotation\nmodulation of the probably smooth polarized radiation emitted in the halo of\nour Galaxy by the fairly local ISM (up to 500 pc). Therefore, the abrupt\nchanges of RM across the `canals' provide evidence for very thin (about 1 pc),\nand relatively long transition regions in the ISM, across which the RM changes\nby as much as 100%. Such drastic RM changes may well be due primarily to abrupt\nchanges in the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2000 16:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A less orthodox\ninterpretation of this Principle is the ``duality condition'' embodied in a\nmathematical inequality due to Englert [B-G Englert, Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 77,\n2154 (1996)] which allows wave and particle attributes to co-exist, but\npostulates that a stronger manifestation of the particle nature leads to a\nweaker manifestation of the wave nature and vice versa. In this Letter, we show\nthat some recent {\\it welcher weg} (\"which path\") experiments in\ninterferometers and similar set-ups, that claim to have validated, or\ninvalidated, the Complementarity Principle, actually shed no light on the\northodox interpretation. They may have instead validated the weaker duality\ncondition, but even that is not completely obvious. We propose simple\nmodifications to these experiments which we believe can test the orthodox\nComplementarity Principle and also shed light on the nature of wavefunction\ncollapse and quantum erasure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2000 22:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2000 23:08:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

A two-mode Gaussian state, one of which is a mixed two-mode squeezed\nvacuum, is separable if and only if a positive well-defined $P$ function can be\nassigned to it. The fidelity of teleportation is considered in terms of the\nnoise factor given by the imperfect channel.
