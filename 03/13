Starbursts contain\nnumerous prominent star clusters which typically comprise in total ~20% of the\nultraviolet light, embedded in a diffuse glow of recently formed stars\nresponsible for the dominant ~80%. Hubble Space Telescope images have been\nobtained for four starburst galaxies in order to determine their burst duration\nfrom the ages of their star clusters. Preliminary results for NGC3310 are\nreported here. The UBI colors of its clusters and diffuse light give consistent\nresults. The clusters have a broad range of colors, consistent with a\npopulation of instantaneous bursts with ages ranging from 0 to a few 100 Myr.\nThe diffuse light has a narrow range of color consistent with continuous star\nformation over timescales ranging from ~ 10 to 100 Myr. Hence NGC3310's\nstarburst has lasted ~100 Myr, or about 10 times the crossing time. Other\nresults noted in the literature also indicate bursts lasting several times\nlonger than the crossing time. These results suggest that starbursts are not\nself-extinguishing flashes. Rather they are sustainable, perhaps\nself-regulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2000 18:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Allowance is made for a possible supermassive black hole, as\nwell as low amplitude friction, noise, and periodic driving which can mimic\nirregularities associated with discreteness effects and/or an external\nenvironment. The degree of chaos is quantified by determining how (1) the\nrelative number of chaotic orbits and (2) the size of the largest Lyapunov\nexponent depend on the steepness of the cusp and the black hole mass, and (3)\nthe extent to which Arnold webs significantly impede phase space transport,\nboth with and without perturbations. In the absence of irregularities, chaotic\norbits tend to be extremely `sticky,' so that different pieces of the same\nchaotic orbit can behave very differently for 10000 dynamical times or longer,\nbut even very low amplitude perturbations can prove efficient in erasing many\n-- albeit not all -- these differences.
