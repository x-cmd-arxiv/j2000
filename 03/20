Assuming that the grains responsible for\noptical extinction are also the source of 850um emission we derive a\nsubmillimeter emissivity (emission efficiency) for dust in the NGC 891 disk.\nThis quantity is found to be a factor of 2-3 higher than the generally-accepted\n(but highly uncertain) values adopted for the Milky Way. It should be stated,\nhowever, that if a substantial fraction of dust in NGC 891 is clumped, the\nemissivity in the two galaxies may be quite similar. We use our newly-acquired\nemissivity to convert our 850um images into detailed maps of dust mass and,\nutilizing 21cm and CO-emission data for NGC 891, derive the gas-to-dust ratio\nalong the disk. We compute an average ratio of 260 -- a value consistent with\nthe Milky Way and external spirals within the uncertainties in deriving both\nthe dust mass and the quantity of molecular gas. The bulk of dust in NGC 891\nappears to be closely associated with the molecular gas phase although it may\nstart to follow the distribution of atomic hydrogen at radii >9 kpc (i.e. >0.5\nR_25).

Common to the many approaches is that the\noriginal logic program, in order to be translated, needs to be well-moded and\nthis has led to the common understanding that these programs can be considered\nto be the ``functional part'' of logic programs. As a consequence of this it\nhas become widely accepted that ``complex'' logical variables, the possibility\nof a dynamic selection rule, and general properties of non-well-moded programs\nare exclusive features of logic programs. This is not quite true, as some of\nthese features are naturally found in lazy functional languages. We readdress\nthe old question of what features are exclusive to the logic programming\nparadigm by defining a simple translation applicable to a wider range of logic\nprograms, and demonstrate that the current circumscription is unreasonably\nrestrictive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2000 09:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The Tamagawa number conjecture describes the\nspecial values of the L-function of a CM elliptic curve in terms of the\nregulator maps of the K-theory of the variety into Deligne and etale\ncohomology. The regulator map to Deligne cohomology was computed by Deninger\nwith the help of the Eisenstein symbol. For the Tamagawa number conjecture one\nneeds an understanding of the $p$-adic regulator on the subspace of K-theory\ndefined by the Eisenstein symbol. This is accomplished by giving a new explicit\ncomputation of the specialization of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf. It turns\nout that this sheaf is an inverse limit of $p^r$-torsion points of a certain\none-motive. The cohomology classes of the elliptic polylogarithm sheaf can then\nbe described by classes of sections of certain line bundles. These sections are\nelliptic units and going carefully through the construction one finds an analog\nof the elliptic Soul\\'e elements. Finally Rubin's ``main conjecture'' of\nIwasawa theory is used to compare these elements with etale cohomology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2000 12:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-26"}
