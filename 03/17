Although the\nthreshold cannot at present be accurately determined (or even quantified)\nobservationally, it is clearly higher for bright Z sources than for faint atoll\nsources. Here we propose that the observational manifestation of kHz QPOs {\\em\nrequires} direct interaction between the neutron star magnetosphere and the\nKeplerian accretion disk and that the cessation of kHz QPOs at high accretion\nrate is due to the lack of such an interact when the Keplerian disk terminates\nat the last stable orbit and yet the magnetosphere is pushed farther inward.\nThe threshold is therefore dependent of the magnetic field strength -- the\nstronger the magnetic field the higher the threshold. This is certainly in\nagreement with the atoll/Z paradigm, but we argue that it is also generally\ntrue, even for individual sources within each (atoll or Z) category. For atoll\nsources, the kHz QPOs also seem to vanish at low accretion rate. Perhaps the\n``disengagement'' between the magnetosphere and the Keplerian disk also takes\nplace under such circumstances, because of, for instance, the presence of\nquasi-spherical advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) close to the neutron\nstar. Unfortunately, in this case, the estimation of the accretion rate\nthreshold would require a knowledge of the physical mechanisms that cause the\ndisengagement.

Light curves of the\nafterglow emissions are obtained by combining the published data with the\npresent measurements in R and I passbands for GRB 991208 and in R, Gunn I and J\npassbands for GRB 991216. They indicate that the flux decay constants of a GRB\nare almost the same in each passband with values about 2.2 for GRB 991208 and\nabout 1.2 for GRB 991216 indicating very fast optical flux decay in the case of\nformer which may be due to beaming effect. However, cause of steepening by 0.23\n+/- 0.06 dex in the R light curve of GRB 991216 afterglow between 2 to 2.5 day\nafter the burst, is presently not understood. Redshift determinations indicate\nthat both GRBs are at cosmological distance with a value of 4.2 Gpc for GRB\n991208 and 6.2 Gpc for GRB 991216. The observed fluence above 20 keV indicates,\nif isotropic, release of energy about 1.3 x 10^{53} erg for GRB 991208 and\nabout 6.7 x 10^{53} erg for GRB 991216 by these bright gamma-ray flashes. The\nenormous amount of released energy will be reduced, if the radiation is beamed\nwhich seems to be case for GRB 991208 afterglow.The quasi-simultaneous\nbroad-band photometric spectral energy distributions of the afterglows are\ndetermined about 8.5 day and about 35 hour after the bursts of GRB 991208 and\nGRB 991216 respectively.The flux decreases exponentially with frequency. The\nvalue of spectral index in the optical-near IR region is -0.75 +/- 0.03 for GRB\n991208 and -1.0 +/- 0.12 for GRB 991216.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2000 15:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A model of the\naxioms is described based on states in and operators on an abstract L fold\ntensor product Hilbert space H^{arith}. Unitary maps of this space onto a\nphysical parameter based product space H^{phy} are then described. Each of\nthese maps makes states in H^{phy}, and the induced operators, a model of the\naxioms. Consequences of the existence of many of these maps are discussed along\nwith the dependence of Grover's and Shor's Algorithms on these maps. The\nimportance of the main physical requirement, that the basic arithmetic\noperations are efficiently implementable, is discussed. This conditions states\nthat there exist physically realizable Hamiltonians that can implement the\nbasic arithmetic operations and that the space-time and thermodynamic resources\nrequired are polynomial in L.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2000 18:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2000 21:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2000 19:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2000 19:46:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2000 15:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

However, there is a quantum theory of mind in which the efficacy of\nmental effort is not affected by decoherence effects. In this theory the\neffects of mental action on brain activity is achieved by a Quantum Zeno Effect\nthat is not weakened by decoherence.

It encompasses all the predictions of\nCopenhagen quantum theory, which include all the validated predictions of\nclassical physical theory. In addition, it forges two-way dynamical links\nbetween the physical and experiential aspects of nature.
