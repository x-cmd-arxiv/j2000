We point out that this conclusion\nresulted from a confusion between the angles measured in the lab frame and in\nthe plasma rest frame. For ordered magnetic field, one would actually obtain a\nlarge value of P because the above mentioned angle would correspond to a very\nlarge angle, theta <= \\pi/2, in the plasma rest frame.

The idea is that potential vorticity\nmixing leads to the formation of a steady organized coarse grained flow,\ncorresponding to the statistical equilibrium state. Our starting point is the\nquasi-geostrophic 1-1/2 layer model, and we consider the relevant limit of a\nsmall Rossby radius of deformation. Then narrow jets are obtained, scaling like\nthe Rossby radius of deformation. These jets can be either zonal, or closed\ninto a ring bounding a vortex. Taking into account the effect of the beta\neffect and a sublayer deep shear flow, we predict an organization of the\nturbulent atmospheric layer into an oval-shaped vortex amidst a background\nshear. Such an isolated vortex is centered over an extremum of the equivalent\ntopography (determined by the deep shear flow and beta-effect). This prediction\nis in agreement with analysis of wind data in major Jovian vortices (Great Red\nSpot and Oval BC).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2000 13:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
