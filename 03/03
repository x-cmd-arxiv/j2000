We analyse some of the implications of these\nmodels for the distribution of the Be/O and B/O abundance ratios. In\nparticular, we discuss the possible scatter in the data and argue that LiBeB\nproduction in the very early Galaxy was probably bimodal, with isolated\nsupernovae giving rise to a low-efficiency mechanism, and collective supernovae\nexploding in an OB association inducing a high-efficiency mechanism. This\nshould produce two populations of halo stars, one with high L/M ratios (light\nelements/metals), and the other with L/M ratios about ten times lower. The\nrelative weight of these two populations depends on the fraction of supernovae\nexploding inside superbubbles. In this context, we discuss the recent\nobservation of the B-depleted, Li-normal star HD 160617 (Primas, et al., 1998),\nas well as the reported spread in the Be data at [Fe/H] ~ -2.2 (Boesgaard, et\nal., 1999).

Our aim is to determine whether, if the disk is\ninitially tilted with respect to the plane of the binary orbit, the inclination\nof the system will increase or decrease with time. The problem is formulated in\nthe binary frame in which the tidal potential of the companion star is static.\nWe consider a steady, flat disk that is aligned with the binary plane and\ninvestigate its linear stability with respect to tilting or warping\nperturbations. The dynamics is controlled by the competing effects of the m=0\nand m=2 azimuthal Fourier components of the tidal potential. In the presence of\ndissipation, the m=0 component causes alignment of the system, while the m=2\ncomponent has the opposite tendency. We find that disks that are sufficiently\nlarge, in particular those that extend to their tidal truncation radii, are\ngenerally stable and will therefore tend to alignment with the binary plane on\na time-scale comparable to that found in previous studies. However, the effect\nof the m=2 component is enhanced in the vicinity of resonances where the outer\nradius of the disk is such that the natural frequency of a global bending mode\nof the disk is equal to twice the binary orbital frequency. Under such\ncircumstances, the disk can be unstable to tilting and acquire a warped shape,\neven in the absence of dissipation. The outer radius corresponding to the\nprimary resonance is always smaller than the tidal truncation radius. For disks\nsmaller than the primary resonance, the m=2 component may be able to cause a\nvery slow growth of inclination through the effect of a near resonance that\noccurs close to the disk center. We discuss these results in the light of\nrecent observations of protostellar disks in binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2000 19:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Acknowledging the fact that both fields originate from\nthe same source, the particle, we can express the magnetic and electric field\nthrough their gravitational respective analogues using the proportionality\ncoefficient k. This coefficient depends on the ratio of mass and charge and the\nratio between the electromagnetic and gravitic-gravitomagnetic permittivity and\npermeability respectively. Although the coefficient is very small, the fact\nthat electromagnetic fields in material media can be used to generate\ngravitational and gravitomagnetic fields and vice versa is not commonly known.\nWe find that the coupling coefficient can be increased by massive ion currents,\nelectron and nuclear spin-alignment. Advances in material sciences, cryogenic\ntechnology and high frequency electromagnetic fields in material media may lead\nto applications of the derived relationships.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2000 13:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nshow that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking\ndetermine the structure of low-energy effective partition functions for the\nDirac spectrum. We thus derive exact results for the low-lying eigenvalues of\nthe QCD Dirac operator. We argue that the statistical properties of these\neigenvalues are universal and can be described by a random matrix theory with\nthe global symmetries of the QCD partition function. The total number of such\neigenvalues increases with the square root of the Euclidean four-volume. The\nspectral density for larger eigenvalues (but still well below a typical\nhadronic mass scale) also follows from the same low-energy effective partition\nfunction. The validity of the random matrix approach has been confirmed by many\nlattice QCD simulations in a wide parameter range. Stimulated by the success of\nthe chiral random matrix theory in the description of universal properties of\nthe Dirac eigenvalues, the random matrix model is extended to nonzero\ntemperature and chemical potential. In this way we obtain qualitative results\nfor the QCD phase diagram and the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator.

They are optimal in the sense\nthat they exactly integrate polynomials of as high a degree as possible for a\nparticular number of points (function evaluations). For smooth integrands, they\nare accurate, computationally efficient formulae.\n  The construction of the points and weights of a Gau{\\ss} rule requires the\nsolution of a system of moment equations. In 1D, this system can be converted\nto a linear system, and a unique solution is obtained, for which the points lie\nwithin the region of integration, and the weights are all positive. These\nproperties help ensure numerical stability, and we describe the rules as\n`good'. In the multidimensional case, the moment equations are nonlinear\nalgebraic equations, and a solution is not guaranteed to even exist, let alone\nbe good. The size and degree of the system grow with the degree of the desired\ncubature rule. Analytic solution generally becomes impossible as the degree of\nthe polynomial equations to be solved goes beyond 4, and numerical\napproximations are required. The uncertainty of the existence of solutions,\ncoupled with the size and degree of the system makes the problem daunting for\nnumerical methods.\n  The construction of Gau{\\ss} rules for (fully symmetric) $n$-dimensional\nregions is easily specialised to the case of $U_3$, the unit sphere in 3D.\nDespite the problems described above, for degrees up to 17, good Gau{\\ss} rules\nfor $U_3$ have been constructed/discovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2000 05:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

While the fluorescence scattering of 172Yb is continuous,\nthe 171Yb fluorescence is interrupted by quantum jumps because a nonvanishing\nrate of spontaneous transitions leads to electron shelving in the metastable\nhyperfine sublevel 2D3/2(F=2). The average duration of the resulting dark\nperiods can be varied by changing the intensity of a repumping laser field.\nOptical heterodyne detection is employed to analyze the fluorescence spectrum\nnear the Rayleigh elastic scattering peak. It is found that the stochastic\nmodulation of the fluorescence emission by quantum jumps gives rise to a\nLorentzian component in the fluorescence spectrum, and that the linewidth of\nthis component varies according to the average duration of the dark\nfluorescence periods. The experimental observations are in quantitative\nagreement with theoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2000 13:35:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2000 15:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
