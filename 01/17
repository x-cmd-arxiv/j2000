For a finite group\nG of nilpotency class 2 of odd order, I construct a basis in its group algebra\nC[G], parameterized by elements of g* so that the elements of coadjoint orbits\nform bases of simple two-side ideals of C[G]. That construction gives us a\none-to-one correspondence between G-orbits in g* and classes of equivalence of\nirreducible unitary representations of G, implying a very simple character\nformula.

To describe behaviour\nof functions defined on multifractal sets the generalizations of the fractional\nRiemann-Liouville derivatives $D_{t}^{d(t)}$ are introduced with the order of\ndifferentiation (depending on time and coordinate) being equal the value of\nfractional dimension. For $d_{t}=const$ the generalized fractional derivatives\n(GFD) reduce to ordinary Riemann-Liouville integral functionals, and when\n$d_{t}$ is close to integer, GFD can be represented by means of derivatives of\ninteger order.
