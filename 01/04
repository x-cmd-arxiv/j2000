The spectral\ncharacteristics of a lot of radio flares in the X-ray binaries with jets (RJXB)\nis discussed in this report. We carried out several long daily monitoring\nprograms with the RATAN-600 radio telescope of the sources: SS433, Cyg X-3,\nLSI+61o303, GRS 1915+10 and some others. We also reviewed some data from the\nGBI monitoring program at two frequencies and hard X-ray BATSE (20-100 keV) and\nsoft X-ray RTXE (2-12 keV) ASM data. We confirmed that flaring radio emission\nof Cyg X-3 correlated with hard and anti-correlated with soft X-ray emission\nduring the strong flare (>$ Jy) in May 1997. During two orbital periods we\ninvestigated radio light curves of the remarkable X-binary LSI+61o303. Two\nflaring events near a phase 0.6 of the 26.5-day orbital period have been\ndetected for first time at four frequencies simultaneously. Powerful flaring\nevents of SS433 were detected at six frequencies in May 1996 and in May 1999.\nThe decay of the flare is exactly fitted by an exponential law and the rate of\nthe decay $\\tau$ depends upon frequency as tau \\propto \\nu^{-0.4} in the first\nflare and does not depend upon frequency in the second flare, and is equal to\n\\tau=6+-1 days at frequencies from 0.96 to 21.7 GHz in the last flare in May\n1999. Many flaring RJXB show two, exponential and power, laws of flare decay.\nMoreover, these different laws could be present in one or several flares and\ncommonly flare decays are faster at a higher frequency. The decay law seems to\nchange because of geometric form of the conical hollow jets. The synchrotron\nand inverse Compton losses could explain general frequency dependences in flare\nevolution. In conclusion we summarized the general radio properties of RJXB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jan 2000 14:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Due to\nthe induced radion dynamics, the inflating branes roll towards the minimum of\nthe radion potential, thereby exiting inflation and reheating the Universe. In\nthe slow roll part of the potential, the 'TeV' branes have maximum inflation\nrate and energy as their coupling to the radion and bulk modes have minimum\nsuppresion. Hence, when rolling down the steep end of the potential towards the\nstable point, the radion field (which appears as the inflaton of the effective\n4D theory in the branes) decays very fast, reheats the Universe .This process\nresults decayin a decrease of brane's canonical vacuum energy $\\Lambda_4$.\nHowever, at the minimum of the potential $\\Lambda_4$ is small but not\nneccessarily zero and the fine-tuning issue remains .Density perturbation\nconstraints introduce an upper bound when the radion stabilizies.

We calculate the specular reflection of x rays by a rough\nsurface and by a smoothly graded surface taking polarization effects into\naccount. In conventional treatments of reflection x rays are treated as scalar\nwaves, polarization effects are neglected. This is a good approximation at\ngrazing incidence but becomes increasingly questionable for soft x rays and UV\nat higher incidence angles.\n  PACs: 61.10.Dp, 61.10.Kw, 03.50.De\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jan 2000 20:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
