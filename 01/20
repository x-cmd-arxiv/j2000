Since no intrinsic absorption is indicated for energies below ~0.4 keV,\nthe most reasonable model for the absorber is collisionally ionized gas at\ntemperatures T=10^{5-6} K with most of the absorption arising from ionized\nstates of oxygen but with a significant contribution from carbon and nitrogen.\nThe soft X-ray emission of this warm gas can explain the sub-Galactic column\ndensities of cold gas inferred within the central regions of most of the\nsystems. Attributing the absorption to ionized gas reconciles the large columns\nof cold H and He inferred from EINSTEIN and ASCA with the lack of such columns\ninferred from ROSAT. Within the central ~10-20 kpc, where the constraints are\nmost secure, the estimated mass of the ionized absorber is consistent with most\n(perhaps all) of the matter deposited by a cooling flow over the lifetime of\nthe flow. Since the warm absorber produces no significant H or He absorption\nthe large absorber masses are consistent with the negligible atomic and\nmolecular H inferred from HI and CO observations of cooling flows.

We try to understand the mechanism\nof field evolution in neutron stars that are members of binary systems with an\naim to understand the problem of millisecond pulsar generation. To this end we\nhave looked at four related problems : i. the effect of diamagnetic screening\non the final field of a neutron star accreting material from its binary\ncompanion; ii. evolution of magnetic flux located in the crust of an accreting\nneutron star; iii. application of the above-mentioned model to real systems and\na comparison with observations; iv. an investigation into the consequences of\nmagnetic flux being initially located in the core of the star and its\nobservational implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2000 10:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
