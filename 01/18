By comparing the observed proper motions of\ncomponents in a parsec scale radio jet to their measured Doppler factors, we\ncan deduce the distance to the radio source independent of the standard rungs\nin the cosmological distance ladder. This technique requires that the jet angle\nto the line of sight and the ratio of pattern to flow velocities are\nsufficiently constrained. We evaluate a number of possibilities for\nconstraining these parameters and demonstrate the technique on a well defined\ncomponent in the parsec scale jet of the quasar 3C279 (z = 0.536). We find an\nangular size distance to 3C279 of greater than 1.8 (+0.5,-0.3) n^{1/8} Gpc,\nwhere n is the ratio of the energy density in the magnetic field to the energy\ndensity in the radiating particles in that jet component. For an Einstein-de\nSitter Universe, this measurement would constrain the Hubble constant to be H <\n65 n^{-1/8} km/s/Mpc at the two sigma level. Similar measurements on higher\nredshift sources may help discriminate between cosmological models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2000 16:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We pay special attention to how this\nHamiltonian depends on quantities which are external to the constraint\nmanifold, such as the external curvature of the constraint manifold, the\n(Riemannian) curvature of the ambient space, and the constraining potential. In\nparticular, we find the remarkable fact that the twisting of the constraining\npotential appears as a gauge potential in the constrained Hamiltonian. This\ngauge potential is an example of geometric phase, closely related to that\noriginally discussed by Berry. The constrained Hamiltonian also contains an\neffective potential depending on the external curvature of the constraint\nmanifold, the curvature of the ambient space, and the twisting of the\nconstraining potential. The general nature of our analysis allows applications\nto a wide variety of problems, such as rigid molecules, the evolution of\nmolecular systems along reaction paths, and quantum strip waveguides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2000 01:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
