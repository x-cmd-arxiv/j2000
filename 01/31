First, we show how doping the pure Kondo\nlattice model in the strong-coupling limit, results in a Pokrovsky-Talapov\ntransition. This produces a conducting state with a charge susceptibility\ndiverging as the inverse of the doping, that seems in agreement with numerical\ndatas. Second, in the weak-coupling region, Kondo insulating transitions arise\ndue to the consequent renormalization of the backward Kondo scattering. Here,\nthe interplay between Kondo effect and electron-electron interactions gives\nrise to significant phenomena in transport, in the high-temperature delocalized\n(ballistic) regime. For repulsive interactions, as a perfect signature of Kondo\nlocalization, the conductivity is found to decrease monotonically with\ntemperature. When interactions become attractive, spin fluctuations in the\nelectron (Luttinger-type) liquid are suddenly lowered. The latter is less\nlocalized by magnetic impurities than for the repulsive counterpart, and as a\nresult a large jump in the Drude weight and a maximum in the conductivity arise\nin the entrance of the Kondo insulating phase. These can be viewed as remnants\nof s-wave superconductivity arising for attractive enough interactions.\nComparisons with transport in the single impurity model are also performed.

If\nD-branes wrap a torus with B-flux the rank of the gauge group is reduced due to\nnon-commuting Wilson lines whose presence is implied by the B-flux. In the case\nof D-branes transverse to a torus with B-flux the rank reduction is due to a\nsmaller number of D-branes required by tadpole cancellation conditions in the\npresence of B-flux as some of the orientifold planes now have the opposite\norientifold projection. We point out that T-duality in the presence of B-flux\nis more subtle than in the case with trivial B-flux, and it is precisely\nconsistent with the qualitative difference between the aforementioned two\nsetups. In the case where both types of branes are present, the states in the\nmixed (e.g., 59) open string sectors come with a non-trivial multiplicity,\nwhich we relate to a discrete gauge symmetry due to non-zero B-flux, and\nconstruct vertex operators for the the mixed sector states. Using these results\nwe revisit K3 orientifolds with B-flux (where K3 is a T^4/Z_M orbifold) and\npoint out various subtleties arising in some of these models. For instance, in\nthe Z_2 case the conformal field theory orbifold does not appear to be the\nconsistent background for the corresponding orientifolds with B-flux. This is\nrelated to the fact that non-zero B-flux requires the presence of both O5^- as\nwell as O5^+ planes at various Z_2 orbifold fixed points, which appears to be\ninconsistent with the presence of the twisted B-flux in the conformal field\ntheory orbifold.
