Since the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\ntraces the structures in the low-redshift universe, we can gain additional\ninsights into the physics of the low-redshift universe by cross-correlating\nmicrowave background maps with template maps produced from the SDSS. We present\na formalism for cross-correlating data from the Microwave Anisotropy Probe\n(MAP) with the Sloan Survey for the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, the\nIntegrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and weak lensing. This formalism is used\nto compute the signal-to-noise for cross-correlating these effects with various\nclasses of tracer objects from the SDSS. It is found that the anticipated\nsamples of SDSS quasars and galaxies with photometrically-determined redshifts\nwould be good tracers for cross-correlating with the CMB. We find that the\nSZ-galaxy cross-correlation would give good constraints on pressure\nfluctuations in supercluster-scale gas. Cross-correlating weakly-lensed quasars\nwith maps of the convergence of the CMB is found to give strong constraints on\nOmega_0 as well as the equation of state w. We find that the ISW\ncross-correlation gives poor signal-to-noise using these techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2000 16:37:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2000 23:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2000 22:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

All involve the failure of neutrino energy deposition to launch a\nstrong supernova explosion. A key quantity which determines the type of high\nenergy transient produced is the ratio of the engine operation time, $\\rm\nt_{engine}$, to the time for the explosion to break out of the stellar surface,\n$\\rm t_{bo}$. Stars with sufficient angular momentum produce collapsars --\nblack holes accreting rapidly through a disk -- in their centers. Collapsars\ncan occur in stars with a wide range of radii depending on the amount of\npre-collapse mass loss. The stellar radius and jet properties determine the\ndegree of beaming of the explosion. In some cases the stellar envelope serves\nto focus the explosion to narrow beaming angles. The baryon loading of various\nmodels for classical GRBs formed in massive stars is examined and the\nconsequences are explored. For $\\rm t_{engine} > t_{bo}$, highly relativistic\noutflow is possible and classical GRBs accompanied by supernovae can be\nproduced. In other cases hyper-energetic, asymmetric supernovae are produced.\nLonger GRBs ($t \\gtaprx 100 \\s$) can be produced by fallback following a weak\nneutrino-driven supernova explosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2000 03:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
