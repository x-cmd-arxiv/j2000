We demonstrate the importance of correcting these\n(and other) pair statistics for selection effects related to sample depth and\ncompleteness. In particular, we highlight the severe bias that can result from\nthe use of a flux-limited survey. The first statistic, denoted N_c, gives the\nnumber of companions per galaxy, within a specified range in absolute\nmagnitude. N_c is directly related to the galaxy merger rate. The second\nstatistic, called L_c, gives the total luminosity in companions, per galaxy.\nThis quantity can be used to investigate the mass accretion rate. Both N_c and\nL_c are related to the galaxy correlation function and luminosity function in a\nstraightforward manner. We outline techniques which account for various\nselection effects, and demonstrate the success of this approach using Monte\nCarlo simulations. If one assumes that clustering is independent of luminosity\n(which is appropriate for reasonable ranges in luminosity), then these\nstatistics may be applied to flux-limited surveys.\n  These techniques are applied to a sample of 5426 galaxies in the SSRS2\nredshift survey.

As the star's spin rate slows, the changing stellar shape stresses the\ncrust and causes fractures.

Earlier studies found that starquakes in spinning-down neutron stars\npush matter toward the magnetic poles, causing temporary misalignment of the\nstar's spin and angular momentum. After the star relaxes to a new equilibrium\norientation, the magnetic poles are closer to the equator, and the magnetic\nbraking torque is increased.

One-point\nprobability distribution functions (pdf's) of dynamical variables have been\nsuggested as appropriate statistical measures and applied to several observed\nmolecular clouds. However, the interpretation of these data requires comparison\nwith numerical simulations. To address this issue, SPH simulations of driven\nand decaying, supersonic, turbulent flows with and without self-gravity are\npresented. In addition, random Gaussian velocity fields are analyzed to\nestimate the influence of variance effects. To characterize the flow\nproperties, the pdf's of the density, of the line-of-sight velocity centroids,\nand of the line centroid increments are studied. This is supplemented by a\ndiscussion of the dispersion and the kurtosis of the increment pdf's, as well\nas the spatial distribution of velocity increments for small spatial lags. From\nthe comparison between different models of interstellar turbulence, it follows\nthat the inclusion of self-gravity leads to better agreement with the observed\npdf's in molecular clouds. The increment pdf's for small spatial lags become\nexponential for all considered velocities. However, all the processes\nconsidered here lead to non-Gaussian signatures, differences are only gradual,\nand the analyzed pdf's are in addition projection dependent. It appears\ntherefore very difficult to distinguish between different physical processes on\nthe basis of pdf's only, which limits their applicability for adequately\ncharacterizing interstellar turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jan 2000 14:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
