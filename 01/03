After a multiple Compton backscattering process the initial positrons may\nlose a substantial part of its energy and, as consequence, may acquire the\nsignificant longitudinal polarization. The simple formulas for the final\npositron energy and polarization degree depended on the laser flash parameters\nhave been obtained.

We use the density matrix theory as\none of the most powerfool tool for investigation of quantum relaxation. In the\nbeginning of the work (chapter 2) we mention and recall the most important\nsteps of derivation of the equation of motion for the reduced density matrix\n(master equation) for an arbitrary quantum system in diabatic representation\ninteracting with the environment modeled by a set of independent harmonic\noscillators. Chapter 3 deals with the question of the border between classical\nand quantum effects and reports on a study of the environmental influence on\nthe time evolution of a coherent state or the superposition of two coherent\nstates of a harmonic oscillator as a simple system displaying the peculiarities\nof the transition from quantum to classical regime. Chapters 4 and 5 concern\nthe electron transfer (ET) problem, namely the mathematical description of the\nET in molecular zinc-porphyrin-quinone complexes modeling artificial\nphotosynthesis (chapter 4) and photoinduced processes in the porphyrin triad\n(chapter 5). Each chapter starts with an introduction and ends with a brief\nsummary.
