We associate this feature, a bifurcation of the\nobserved elemental ratios into two branches in the Mg abundance interval -2.7 <\n[Mg/H] < -2.3, with two distinct processes. The first branch, which we call the\n``y''-branch, is associated with the production of Ba and Mg from individual\nmassive supernovae. We conclude that SNe II with Mms = 20 Msun are the dominant\nsource of r-process nucleosynthesis in the early Galaxy. An SN-induced chemical\nevolution model with this Mms-dependent Ba yield creates the y-branch,\nreflecting the different nucleosynthesis yields of [Ba/Mg] for each SN II with\nMms > 20 Msun.

The Ba abundances in these stars reflect\nthose of the interstellar gas at the (later) time of their formation. The\nexistence of a [Ba/Mg] i-branch strongly suggests that SNe II which are\nassociated with stars of progenitor mass Mms < 20 Msun are infertile sources\nfor the production of r-process elements.

When the Fermi surface is a surface of\nrevolution, the expression for the effective impedance is rather simple. Some\nmodel Fermi surfaces were examined. In the vicinity of the electronic\ntopological transition the singularities of the effective impedance related to\nthe change of the topology of the Fermi surface were calculated. Our results\nshow that though a polycrystal is an isotropic medium in average, it is not\nsufficient to consider it as a metal with an effective spherical Fermi surface,\nsince this can lead to the loss of some characteristic features of extremely\nanomalous skin effect in polycrystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2000 10:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Exploiting the semantics of these operations\nenables a wider set of transformations to be used, and is critical for\noptimizing important codes such as LU factorization with pivoting.\n  Symbolic execution of programs enables the exploitation of such semantic\nproperties, but it is intractable for all but the simplest programs.
