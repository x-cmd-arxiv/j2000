Preceding\ncalculations in chiral effective field theories only employed pion and nucleon\ndegrees of freedom and were not able to reproduce the photon spectrum in the\npioneering experiment of radiative muon capture on the proton from TRIUMF. For\nthe past few years it has been speculated that the discrepancy between theory\nand experiment might be due to Delta(1232) related effects, which are only\nincluded via higher order contact interactions in the standard chiral approach.\nIn this report we demonstrate that this speculation does not hold true. We show\nthat contrary to expectations from naive dimensional analysis isobar effects on\nthe photon spectrum and the total rate in radiative muon capture are of the\norder of a few percent, consistent with earlier findings in a more\nphenomenological approach. We further demonstrate that both ordinary and\nradiative muon capture constitute systems with a very well behaved chiral\nexpansion, both in standard chiral perturbation theory and in the small scale\nexpansion, and present some new ideas that might be at the bottom of the still\nunresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment in radiative muon capture.\nFinally we comment upon the procedure employed by the TRIUMF group to extract\nnew information from their radiative muon capture experiment on the\npseudoscalar form factor of the nucleon. We show that it is inconsistent with\nthe ordinary muon capture data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2000 08:57:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2000 10:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
