To investigate the possible role\nof Fe abundance gradients on these measurements we present deprojection\nanalysis of the ROSAT PSPC data of 10 of the brightest cooling flow galaxies\nand groups. The PSPC allows for spatially resolved spectral analysis on a\nhalf-arcminute scale, and interesting constraints on both the temperatures and\nFe abundances are possible because the ~1 keV temperatures of these systems are\nwell matched to the bandpass of the PSPC. In 9 out of 10 systems we find clear\nevidence that the Fe abundance decreases with increasing radius: Z_Fe ~1 solar\n- (several) solar within the central radial bin (r < ~10 kpc) which decreases\nto Z_Fe ~0.5 solar at the largest radii examined (r ~50-100 kpc). The Fe\nabundances (and temperatures) are consistent with the average values for these\nsystems that we obtained in our previous analyses of the ASCA data using\nmultitemperature models which confirms that previous inferences of very\nsub-solar Fe abundances from ASCA arise from the incorrect assumption of\nisothermal gas and not the presence of Fe abundance gradients. We discuss why\nthis ``Fe Bias'' affects much more seriously the measurements of Z_Fe from ASCA\ndata than from ROSAT data.

We consider the unit spheres $SH^0_J(M,\nL^N)$ in the spaces $H^0_J(M, L^N)$, which we equip with natural inner\nproducts. Our purpose is to show that, in a probabilistic sense, almost\nholomorphic sections behave like holomorphic sections as $N \\to \\infty$. Our\nfirst main result is that almost all sequences of sections $s_N \\in SH^0_J(M,\nL^N)$ are `asymptotically holomorphic' in the Donaldson-Auroux sense that\n$||s_N||_{\\infty}/||s_N||_{2} = O(\\sqrt{\\log N})$, $||\\bar{\\partial}\ns_N||_{\\infty}/||s_N||_{2} = O(\\sqrt{\\log N})$ and $||\\partial\ns_N||_{\\infty}/||s_N||_{2} = O(\\sqrt{N \\log N})$.

We show that this joint distribution has a\nuniversal scaling limit about $P_0$ as $N \\to \\infty$. In particular, the limit\nis precisely the same as in the complex holomorphic case. Our methods involve\nnear-diagonal scaling asymptotics of the Szeg\\\"o projector $\\Pi_N$ onto\n$H^0_J(M, L^N)$, which also yields proofs of symplectic analogues of the\nKodaira embedding theorem and Tian asymptotic isometry theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jan 2000 04:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2000 16:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
