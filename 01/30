In this paper we focus, rather than on the evaluation of the exponents,\non elucidating the {\\em physical mechanism} responsible for the anomaly. We\nshow that the anomalous exponents $\\zeta_n$ stem from the Lagrangian dynamics\nof shapes which characterize configurations of n points in space. Using the\nshape-to-shape transition probability, we define an operator whose eigenvalues\ndetermine the anomalous exponents for all n, in all the sectors of the SO(3)\nsymmetry group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jan 2000 08:45:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
