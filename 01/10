Similarly large quantities of ionized gas could be\nhidden in these systems as well. The properties of some of the gas reservoirs\nare similar to the median properties of the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs); two of\nthe HI reservoirs are catalogued HVCs. The association of the HI with the dwarf\nspheroidals might thus provide a link between the HVCs and stars.
