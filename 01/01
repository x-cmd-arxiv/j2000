Doppler shifts due to supersonic motions contain information on\nturbulent velocity field which is otherwise difficult to measure. However, the\nproblem of separation of velocity and density fluctuations is far from being\ntrivial. Using atomic hydrogen (HI) as a test case, I review techniques\napplicable to emission line studies with the emphasis on those that can provide\ninformation on the underlying power spectra of velocity and density. I show\nthat recently developed mathematical machinery is promising for the purpose.\nIts application to HI shows that in cold neutral hydrogen the velocity\nfluctuations dominate the small scale structures observed in spectral-line data\ncubes and this result is very important for the interpretation of observational\ndata, including the identification of clouds. Velocity fluctuations are shown\nto dominate the formation of small scale structures that can be erroneously\nidentified as diffuse clouds. One may argue that the HI data is consistent with\nthe Goldreich-Shridhar picture of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, but the\ncascade from the scales of several kpc that this interpretation involves does\nnot fit well in the current paradigm of energy injection. The issue whether\nmagnetic field does make the turbulence anisotropic is still open, but if this\nis the case, I show that studies of emission lines can provide a reliable way\nof determining magnetic field direction. I discuss various techniques for\nstudying interstellar turbulence using emission lines, e.g. spectral\ncorrelation functions, genus statistics and principal component analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2000 02:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
