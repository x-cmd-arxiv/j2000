The best\npower-law PDSs are displayed by the longest bursts (T_90>100 s) in which the\nrange of self-similar time scales covers more than 2 decades. Shorter bursts\nhave apparent PDS slopes more strongly affected by statistical fluctuations.\nThe underlying power law can then be reproduced with high accuracy by averaging\nthe PDSs for a large sample of bursts. This power law has a slope approximately\nequal to -5/3 and a sharp break at about 1 Hz.\n  The power-law PDS provides a new sensitive tool for studies of GRBs. In\nparticular, we calculate the PDSs of bright bursts in separate energy channels.\nThe PDS flattens in the hard channel (h\\nu>300 keV) and steepens in the soft\nchannel (h\\nu<50 keV), while the PDS of bolometric light curves approximately\nfollows the -5/3 law.\n  We then study dim bursts and compare them to the bright ones. We find a\nstrong correlation between the burst brightness and the PDS slope. This\ncorrelation shows that the bursts are far from being standard candles and dim\nbursts should be intrinsically weak. The time dilation of dim bursts is\nprobably related to physical processes occurring in the burst rather than to a\ncosmological redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2000 17:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The\nlarge-N approximation is used to study the evolution of the model in the\npresence of a stationary flow and in the case of an oscillating shear.\n  For stationary flow we show that the structure factor obeys a generalized\ndynamical scaling.

The mathematics of\neigenfunctions are similar to the top-down eigenfunctions developed by Nunez,\nalbeit they have different physical manifestations. The bottom-up\neigenfunctions are at the local mesocolumnar scale, whereas the top-down\neigenfunctions are at the global regional scale. However, as described in\nseveral joint papers, our approaches have regions of substantial overlap, and\nfuture studies may expand top-down eigenfunctions into the bottom-up\neigenfunctions, yielding a model of scalp EEG that is ultimately expressed in\nterms of columnar states of neocortical processing of attention and short-term\nmemory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2000 20:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
