We find that the soft X-ray emission from\ngalactic winds comes from low filling factor (ff < 2 per cent) gas, which\ncontains only a small fraction (f < 10 per cent) of the mass and energy of the\nwind, irrespective of whether the wind models are strongly mass-loaded or not.\nX-ray observations of galactic winds therefore do not directly probe the gas\nthat contains the majority of the energy, mass or metal-enriched gas in the\noutflow. The soft X-ray emission comes from gas at a wide range different\ntemperatures and densities. Estimates of the physical properties of the hot gas\nin starburst galaxies, based on fitting the standard simple spectral models to\nexisting X-ray spectra, should therefore be treated with extreme suspicion. The\nmajority of the thermal and kinetic energy of these winds is in a volume\nfilling hot, T approx 10^7 K, component which is extremely difficult to probe\nobservationally due to its low density and hence low emissivity. Most of the\ntotal energy is in the kinetic energy of this hot gas, a factor which must be\ntaken into account when attempting to constrain wind energetics\nobservationally. We also find that galactic winds are efficient at transporting\nlarge amounts of energy out of the host galaxy, in contrast to their\ninefficiency at transporting mass out of star-forming galaxies.

The evolution of the star formation\nactivity is followed on a wide range of redshifts (0< z < 4) covering most of\nthe history of the Universe. Two incompatible interpretations of the\nobservations are currently competing. After applying star formation rate (SFR)\nconversion factors to the CFRS, Halpha or ISO samples, many authors conclude to\na strong increase (~ a factor 10) of the SFR from z=0 to z=1. They also find\nsome evidence for a peak at z~1 and for a rapid decrease at higher redshifts.\nOn the other side, the Hawaii deep surveys favor only a mild increase between\nz=0 and 1 (Cowie et al., 1996, 1999). To understand the reason for these\ndiscrepant interpretations, we consider three classes of galaxies: E/S0,\nSa-Sb-Sbc, Sc-Sd-Im and bursting dwarfs. We use the new version of our\nevolutionary synthesis code, PEGASE which takes into account metallicity and\ndust effects. The main results are: i) Late-type galaxies contribute\nsignificantly to the local SFR, especially bursting dwarfs (Fioc and\nRocca-Volmerange, 1999). Because of that, the cosmic SFR can not decrease by a\nfactor 10 from z=0 to 1. This is in agreement with Cowie's result. ii) The SFR\nof intermediate-type galaxies has strongly decreased since z=1. Though the\ndecrease is less than what find Lilly et al., 1996, this suggests that the CFRS\nand Halpha surveys are dominated by such bright early spirals. iii) The\ncontribution of early-type galaxies increases rapidly from z=1 to their\nredshift of formation (> 2-3 for cosmological reasons). Their intense star\nformation rates at high-z give strong constraints on early ionization phases,\nprimeval populations or metal enrichments.(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2000 10:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We study finite\nsize effects and the dependence on the time step of the path integral. Further,\nwe compare the results obtained with a free particle nodal restriction with\nthose from a self-consistent variational principle, which includes interactions\nand bound states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2000 02:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
