Here, we present a novel empirical method which bypasses all the\ndifficulties of the previous approaches by monitoring external indicators of an\nanomalously growing interest in the public at times of bubbles. From the\ndefinition of a bubble as a self-fulfilling reinforcing price change, we\nidentify indicators of a possible self-reinforcing imitation between agents in\nthe market. We show that during the build-up phase of a bubble, there is a\ngrowing interest in the public for the commodity in question, whether it\nconsists in stocks, diamonds or coins. That interest can be estimated through\ndifferent indicators: increase in the number of books published on the topic,\nincrease in the subscriptions to specialized journals. Moreover, the well-known\nempirical rule according to which the volume of sales is growing during a bull\nmarket finds a natural interpretation in this framework: sales increases in\nfact reveal and pinpoint the progress of the bubble's diffusion throughout\nsociety. We also present a simple model of rational expectation which maps\nexactly onto the Ising model on a random graph. The indicators are then\ninterpreted as ``thermometers'', measuring the balance between idiosyncratic\ninformation (noise temperature) and imitation (coupling) strength. In this\ncontext, bubbles are interpreted as low or critical temperature phases, where\nthe imitation strength carries market prices up essentially independently of\nfundamentals. Contrary to the naive conception of a bubble and a crash as times\nof disorder, on the contrary, we show that bubbles and crashes are times where\nthe concensus is too strong.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2000 22:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Thereby we evaluated single-particle spectra (PES &\nIPES), two-particle spectra (spin & density correlation functions), and the\ndynamical correlation function of suitably defined diagnostic operators, all as\na function of temperature and hole doping. The results allow to identify\ndifferent physical regimes. Near half-filling we find an anomalous `Hubbard-I\nphase', where the band structure is, up to some minor modifications, consistent\nwith the Hubbard-I predictions. At lower temperatures, where the spin response\nbecomes sharp, additional dispersionless `bands' emerge due to the dressing of\nelectrons/holes with spin excitatons. We present a simple phenomenological fit\nwhich reproduces the band structure of the insulator quantitatively. The Fermi\nsurface volume in the low doping phase, as derived from the single-particle\nspectral function, is not consistent with the Luttinger theorem, but\nqualitatively in agreement with the predictions of the Hubbard-I approximation.\nThe anomalous phase extends up to a hole concentration of 15%, i.e. the\nunderdoped region in the phase diagram of high-T_c superconductors. We also\ninvestigate the nature of the magnetic ordering transition in the single\nparticle spectra. We show that the transition to an SDW-like band structure is\nnot accomplished by the formation of any resolvable `precursor bands', but\nrather by a (spectroscopically invisible) band of spin 3/2 quasiparticles. We\ndiscuss implications for the `remnant Fermi surface' in insulating cuprate\ncompounds and the shadow bands in the doped materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2000 15:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

There remains only to determine how the wall gets embedded\nin these two geometries. In this approximation, the ratio $k$ of the false\nvacuum to surface energy densities is a measure of the symmetry breaking scale\n$\\eta$. Solutions are characterized by this ratio, the charge on the wall $Q$,\nand the value of the conserved total energy $M$. We find that for each fixed\n$k$ and $Q$ up to some critical value, there exists a unique globally static\nsolution, with $M\\simeq Q^{3/2}$; any stable radial excitation has $M$ bounded\nabove by $Q$, the value assumed in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om geometry\nand these are the only solutions with $M<Q$.

The analysis is motivated by experiments conducted\nunder the low level and random effective acceleration field that is typical of\na microgravity environment. When the boundary is planar and is being vibrated\nalong its own plane, the variance of the velocity field decays as a power law\nof distance away from the boundary. If a low frequency cut-off is introduced in\nthe power spectrum of the boundary velocity, the variance decays exponentially\nfor distances larger than a Stokes layer thickness based on the cut-off\nfrequency. Vibration of a gently curved boundary results in steady streaming in\nthe ensemble average of the tangential velocity. Its amplitude diverges\nlogarithmically with distance away from the boundary, but asymptotes to a\nconstant value instead if a low frequency cut-off is considered. This steady\ncomponent of the velocity is shown to depend logarithmically on the cut-off\nfrequency. Finally, we consider the case of a periodically modulated solid\nboundary that is being randomly vibrated. We find steady streaming in the\nensemble average of the first order velocity, with flow extending up to a\ncharacteristic distance of the order of the boundary wavelength.

For a bond, a four-particle system, charge\ninversion is the key to explain this shape generically. A parity adapted\nHamiltonian reduces from ten to two terms. The analytical perturbed Coulomb\nfunction scales attractive and repulsive branches of 13 PECs (HH, HF, LiH, KH,\nAuH, LiLi, LiF, KLi, NaCs, RbRb,RbCs, CsCs and II) in a single straight line.\nTurning points are reproduced with a deviation of 0.3 % (0.007 angstrom). At\nthe repulsive side, the deviation is 0.2 % (0.003 angstrom). The ab initio zero\nmolecular parameter function gives PECs of acceptable quality, just using\natomic ionisation energies. The function can be used as a model potential for\ninverting energy levels. The theory may be tested with femtochemistry.\nReactions between hydrogen and anti-hydrogen, feasible in the near future, will\nprobably produce normal HH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2000 06:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Our first result is that quantum secret-sharing is\npossible for any structure for which no two disjoint sets can reconstruct the\nsecret (this was also proved, somewhat differently, by D. Gottesman). To obtain\nthis we show that a large class of linear classical SS schemes can be converted\ninto quantum schemes of the same efficiency.\n  We also give a necessary and sufficient condiion for the direct conversion of\nclassical schemes into quantum ones, and show that all group homomorphic\nschemes satisfy it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2000 21:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
