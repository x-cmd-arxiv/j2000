Despite the thinness of the plateau,\nan increase of Li with [Fe/H] is seen, interpreted as evidence of Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) of Li, primarily due to Galactic cosmic ray (GCR)\nspallation reactions in the era of halo formation. The rate of Li evolution is\nconcordant with: (1) observations of spallative 6Li in halo dwarfs; (2) GCE\nmodels; and (3) data on Li in higher metallicity halo stars.

We explain their\nlow Li abundances by normal pre-main-sequence (and possibly main-sequence)\ndestruction in the low mass stars prior to their merging.

According to the model this\nvariability is the combined outcome of random (Poisson) injection of soft\nphotons near the center of an extended {\\sl inhomogeneous} distribution of hot\nelectrons (similar to those advocated by the ADAF or ADIOS flows) and the\nstochastic nature of Compton scattering which converts these soft photons into\nthe observed high energy radiation. Thus, the timing properties (PSD, lags,\ncoherence) of the BHC light curves reflect, to a large extent, the properties\nof the scattering medium (which in this approximation acts as a combination of\na {\\sl linear} amplifier/filter) and they can be used to probe its structure,\nmost notably the density profile of the scattering medium. The model accounts\nwell for the observed PSDs and lags and also the reduction in the RMS\nvariability and the increase in the characteristic PSD frequencies with\nincreasing source luminosity. The electron density profiles obtained to date\nare consistent mainly with those of ADIOS but also with pure ADAF flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2000 21:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Using cosmological simulations we study\nthe effects of such a modification of the initial power spectrum. While the\nhalo multiplicity function depends primarily on the linear theory power\nspectrum, most other probes of power are more sensitive to the non-linear power\nspectrum.

The\nwell-known scaling relations, L-V (Tully-Fisher relation), V-R (also the\nTully-Fisher relation) and R-L (Freeman's law), can be understood as oblique\nprojections of the surfboard-like plane into 2-D spaces.

Propagation of chaos means that molecular chaos, i.e.,\nthe stochastic independence of two random particles in a many-particle system,\npersists in time, as the number of particles tends to infinity.\n  We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of general\nn-particle Markov processes to propagate chaos. This condition is expressed in\nterms of the Markov transition functions associated to the n-particle\nprocesses, and it amounts to saying that chaos of random initial states\npropagates if it propagates for pure initial states.\n  Our proof of this result relies on the weak convergence approach to the study\nof chaos due to Sznitman and Tanaka.

Newtonian cosmology formulated by\nHeckmann agrees implicitly with Cartan's formulation of Newtonian mechanics as\ngeodesic motion in space-time, but does not unfold the underlying geometric\npicture. I present the transformation theory of Newtonian mechanics and gravity\ndeveloped by Cartan and Heckmann, and show via coordinate transformations that\nHeckmann's Newtonian cosmological model has a center, so that the cosmological\nprinciple cannot hold globally.\n  It is possible to confuse the relativity principle with a position of\nrelativism. Mach's principle has much to do with the latter and nothing to do\nwith the former. Both general relativity and nonlinear dynamics inform us that\nmost coordinate systems ae defined locally by differential equations that are\nglobally nonintegrable: global extensions of local coordinates usually do not\nexist. I explain how defining inertial frames locally by free fall\nshort-circuits Mach's philosophic objectios to Newtonian dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2000 20:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

The quantum discrete nonlinear Schroedinger model\n(DNLS) is our main objective, but its so called modified discrete nonlinear\n(MDNLS) version is also included, together with the fermionic polaron (FP)\nmodel. Based on the respective dynamical symmetries of the models, a method is\nput forward which by use of the associated boson and spin coherent state\nvectors (CSV) and a factorization ansatz for the solution of the Schroedinger\nequation, leads to quasiclassical Hamiltonian equations of motion for the CSV\nparameters. Analysing the geometrical content of the factorization ansatz made\nfor the state vectors invokes the study of the Riemannian and symplectic\ngeometry of the CSV manifolds as generalized phase spaces. Next, we investigate\nanalytically and numerically the behavior of mean values and uncertainties of\nsome physically interesting observables as well as the modifications in the\nquantum regime of processes such as the discrete self trapping (DST), in terms\nof the Q-function and the distribution of excitation quanta of the lattice\nsites. Quantum DST in the symmetric ordering of lattice operators is found to\nbe relatively enhanced with respect to the classical DST. Finally, the meaning\nof the factorization ansatz for the lattice wave function is explained in terms\nof disregarded quantum correlations, and as a quantitative figure of merit for\nthat ansatz a correlation index is introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2000 16:56:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
