A two-zone model is proposed that distinguishes between compact, bright\nsteep-spectrum radio knots and the bright fragmented radio ring on the one\nhand, and the remainder of the shell - the diffuse `plateau' - on the other\nhand. In the framework of this model it is possible to explain the basic\nfeatures of the spectral and temporal evolution of the synchrotron radiation of\nCas A if one assumes that these compact structures correspond to sites of\nefficient electron acceleration producing hard spectra of accelerated particles\nwith power-law indices ~2.2.

Current fashionable supersymmetric models provide a\nnatural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric particle\n(LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like the quark\nsubstructure of the nucleon and the nuclear form factor and the spin response\nfunction of the nucleus, permit the evaluation of the event rate for\nLSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however,\nvery low or even undetectable. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation\neffect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion. In\nthis review we study such a modulation effect in directional and undirectional\nexperiments. We calculate both the differential and the total rates using\nsymmetric as well as asymmetric velocity distributions. We find that in the\nsymmetric case the modulation amplitude is small, less than 0.07. There exist,\nhowever, regions of the phase space and experimental conditions such that the\neffect can become larger. The inclusion of asymmetry, with a realistic enhanced\nvelocity dispersion in the galactocentric direction, yields the bonus of an\nenhanced modulation effect, with an amplitude which for certain parameters can\nbecome as large as 0.46.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2000 18:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}
