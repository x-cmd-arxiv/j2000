The problem involves the motion of a\nchain molecule of $N$ segments across a region where the free energy per\nsegment is higher, so that it has to cross a barrier. We consider the limit\nwhere the length of the molecule is much larger than the width of the barrier.\nThe width is taken to be sufficiently wide that a coninuum description is\napplicable to even to the portion over the barrier. We use the Rouse model and\nanalyze the mechanism of crossing a barrier. There can be two dominant\nmechanisms. They are: end crossing and hairpin crossing. We find the free\nenergy of activation for the hairpin crossing is two times that for end\ncrossing. In both cases, the activation energy has a square root dependence on\nthe temperature $T$, leading to a non-Arrhenius form for the rate. We also show\nthat there is a special time dependent solution of the model, which corresponds\nto a kink in the chain, confined to the region of the barrier. The movement of\nthe polymer from one side to the other is equivalent to the motion of the kink\non the chain in the reverse direction. We also consider the translocation of\nhydrophilic polypeptides across hydrophobic pores, a process that is quite\ncommon in biological systems. Biological systems accomplish this by having a\nhydrophobic signal sequence at the end that goes in first. We find that for\nsuch a molecule, the transition state resembles a hook, and this is in\nagreement with presently accepted view in cell biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jan 2000 06:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

There are\ntwo types of solution, determined by the solution's behaviour at jump times of\nthe process X, one we call geometric the other forward. The geometric solution\nis obtained by adding fictitious time and solving an associated integral\nequation. The forward solution is derived from the geometric solution by\ncorrecting the solution's jump behaviour. L\\'evy processes, generally, have\nunbounded variation. So we must use a pathwise integral different from the\nLebesgue-Stieltjes integral. When X has finite p-variation almost surely for\np<2 we use Young's integral. This is defined whenever f and g have finite p and\nq-variation for 1/p+1/q>1 (and they have no common discontinuities). When p>2\nwe use the integral of Lyons.

The pairing matrix elements are written as a separable\npart plus a remainder that vanishes when either momentum variable is on the\nFermi surface. This decomposition effects a separation of the problem of\ndetermining the dependence of the gap components in a spin-angle representation\non the magnitude of the momentum (described by a set of functions independent\nof magnetic quantum number) from the problem of determining the dependence of\nthe gap on angle or magnetic projection. The former problem is solved through a\nset of nonsingular, quasilinear integral equations, providing inputs for\nsolution of the latter problem through a coupled system of algebraic equations\nfor a set of numerical coefficients. An incisive criterion is given for finding\nthe upper critical density for closure of the triplet gap. The separation\nmethod and its development for triplet pairing exploit the existence of a small\nparameter, given by a gap-amplitude measure divided by the Fermi energy. The\nrevised BCS equations admit analysis revealing universal properties of the full\nset of solutions for $^3$P$_2$ pairing in the absence of tensor coupling,\nreferring especially to the energy degeneracy and energetic order of these\nsolutions.
