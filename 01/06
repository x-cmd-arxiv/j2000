Limitations of actual model atmospheres when fine precision is\nrequired for the calculations of partial derivatives and integrals, which\ndepend on limb darkening coefficients, are discussed. Two methods are discussed\nto calculate the phase lags, the angle between maximum temperature and minimum\nradius, and R, a parameter which describes departure from adiabaticity of the\natmospheres of these pulsating stars. These quantities appear to be very\ndependent on the convection as parametrized by the mixing length theory. When\none of the methods is applied to the gamma Dor stars gives phase lags close to\n0 degrees, which are 90-180 degrees out of phase from typical delta Scuti\nstars. Examples are given for some High Amplitude Delta Scuti Stars (HADS)\nwhere the method can be easily applied and gives results consistent to\ninterpret them as radial (l=0) pulsating stars. Other low amplitude delta Scuti\nstars could be oscillating in a non-radial (l=1, 2) mode.

We point out that a similar structure is present in the CMD of NGC\n7789, and discuss their possible origins. This feature may be understood as the\nresult of having, at the same time, stars of low-mass which undergo the\nhelium-flash, and those just massive enough for avoiding it. The ages of both\nclusters are compatible with this interpretation. Similar features can be\nproduced in theoretical models which assume a non-negligible mass spread for\nclump stars, of about 0.2 Mo. However, one can probably exclude that the\nobserved effect is due to the natural mass range of core helium burning stars\nfound in single isochrones, although present models do not present the level of\ndetail necessary to completely explore this possibility. Also the possibility\nof a large age spread among cluster stars can be refuted on observational\ngrounds. We then suggest a few alternatives.

Alternatively, effects sush as stellar rotation or convective core\novershooting, could be causing a significant spread in the core mass at\nHe-ignition for star of similar mass.
