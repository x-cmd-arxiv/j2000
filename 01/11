Here we report on the spectroscopic\nidentification of 9 Ly alpha emitters at z=3.13, obtained with the FORS\nspectrograph at Unit 1 of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT UT1). The spectra\nof these high redshift objects show a narrow, isolated Ly alpha emission with\nvery faint (frequently undetected) continuum, indicating a large equivalent\nwidth. No other features are visible in our spectra. Our Ly alpha emitters are\nquite similar to those found by Hu (1998), Cowie & Hu (1998) and Hu et al.\n(1998). Using simple population synthesis models, on the assumption that these\nsources are regions of star formation, we conclude that the nebulae are nearly\noptically thick and must have a very low dust content, in order to explain the\nhigh observed Ly alpha equivalent widths. For the cosmological and star\nformation parameters we adopted, the total stellar mass produced would seem to\ncorrespond to the formation of rather small galaxies, some of which are perhaps\ndestined to merge. The implied star formation density in our sampled comoving\nvolume is probably somewhat smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as\nthe star formation density at z=3 derived by other authors from Lyman-break\ngalaxy surveys. This result agrees with the expectation that the Ly alpha\nemitters are a low-metallicity (or low-dust) tail in a distribution of star\nforming regions at high redshifts. Finally, the Ly alpha emitters may\ncontribute as many H-ionizing photons as QSOs at z=3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2000 16:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-28"}

Emission from SiO\nand H13CO+ is extended in the nucleus of NGC253. The bulk of the SiO/H13CO+\nemission arises from a 600pcx250pc circumnuclear disk (CND) with a double\nringed structure.

The QSO stacked spectra, in the observers\n0.1-2 keV band, in five redshift bins over the range 0.1<z<3.2 apparently\nharden from an equivalent photon index of 2.6 at z=0.4 to ~2.1 at z=2.4 as seen\nin other QSO samples. In contrast, the spectra in the 0.5-2 keV band show no\nsignificant variation in spectral index with redshift. This suggests the\npresence of a spectral upturn at low energies (<0.5 keV). Indeed, while at high\nredshifts (z>1.0) the single power-law model gives an acceptable fit to the\ndata over the full energy band, at lower redshifts the spectra need a second\ncomponent at low energies, a `soft excess'. Inclusion of a simple model for the\nsoft excess, i.e. a black-body component (kT~100 eV), results in a significant\nimprovement to the model fit, and yields power-law slopes of 1.8-1.9, for all\nredshift bins. This power-law is not inconsistent, within the error bars, with\nthose of nearby AGN in the 2-10 keV band, suggesting that the same intrinsic\npower-law slope may continue from 10 keV down to below 0.5 keV. We caution that\nthere is a possibility that the spectral upturn observed may not represent a\nreal physical component but could be due to co-adding spectra with a large\ndispersion in spectral indices. Regardless of the origin of the soft excess,\nthe average QSO spectrum has important consequences for the origin of the X-ray\nbackground: the average spectra of the typical, faint, high redshift QSO are\nsignificantly steeper than the spectrum of the X-ray background extending the\nspectral paradox into the soft 0.1-2 keV X-ray band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2000 12:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In the process, we analyse -- in the\nmost general context -- the impact of stochastic variables on the P&L of a\nhedged portfolio, and we conclude that no model can a priori be expected to\nprice all exotics in line with the vanilla options market. Calibration of an\nassumed underlying process from vanilla options alone must not be overly\nrestrictive, yet still unique, and relevant to all exotic options of interest.\nFor the implied tree we show that the calibration to real-world prices allows\nus to only price vanilla options themselves correctly. This is usually\nattributed to the incompleteness of the market under traditional stochastic\n(local) volatility models. We show that some `weakly' stochastic volatility\nmodels without quadratic variation of the volatilities avoid the incompleteness\nproblems, but they introduce arbitrage. More generally, we find that any\nstochastic tradable either has quadratic variation -- and therefore a\n$\\Ga$-like P&L on instruments with non-linear exposure to that asset -- or it\nintroduces arbitrage opportunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jan 2000 19:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-10"}

After discussing the limitations of the orthodox\napproach, we propose an alternative that appears to be quite naturally implied\nby recent developments based on D-brane physics. In this new alternative: 1)\nThe gauge group, above a scale of order 1 TeV, is the minimal left-right\nsymmetric extension $SU(3)\\times SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ of the\nSM; 2) Quarks, leptons and Higgs fields come in three generations; 3) Couplings\nunify at an intermediate string scale $M_s= 9\\times 10^{11}$ GeV with boundary\nconditions $g_3^2=g_L^2=g_R^2=32/3 g_{B-L}^2$. This corresponds to the natural\nembedding of gauge interactions into D-branes and is different from the\nstandard SO(10) embedding which corresponds to $k_{B-L}=8/3$. Unification only\nworks in the case of three generations;\n  4) Proton stability is automatic due to the presence of $Z_2$ discrete\nR-parity and lepton parities. A specific Type IIB string orientifold model with\nthe above characteristics is constructed. The existence of three generations is\ndirectly related to the existence of three complex extra dimensions.\n  In this model the string scale can be identified with the intermediate scale\nand SUSY is broken also at that scale due to the presence of anti-branes in the\nvacuum.\n  We discuss a number of phenomenological issues in this model including Yukawa\ncouplings and a built-in axion solution to the strong-CP problem. The present\nframework could be tested by future accelerators by finding the left-right\nsymmetric extension of the SM at a scale of order 1 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2000 13:06:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2000 16:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-23"}

For the\nfirst longitudinal mode of the cylindrical resonator we measured a conversion\nfactor of 7.4 +- 1.4 nm/J, confirming the model value of 10 nm/J. Also, for the\nspherical resonator, we found the model values for the L=2 and L=1 mode\namplitudes to be consistent with our measurement. We thus have confirmed the\napplicability of the model, and we note that calculations based on the model\nhave shown that next generation resonant mass gravitational wave detectors can\nonly be expected to reach their intended ultra high sensitivity if they will be\nshielded by an appreciable amount of rock, where a veto detector can reduce the\nbackground of remaining impinging cosmic rays effectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2000 14:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-12-15"}

The Dirac equation, in the case of electromagnetic interaction,\nis not invariant under unitary time inversion, giving rise to a ``Klein\nparadox''. To render unitary time inversion invariance, a nonlinear wave\nequation is constructed, in which the ``Klein paradox'' disappears. In the case\nof Coulomb interaction, the revised nonlinear equation can be linearized to\ngive energy solutions for Hydrogen-like ions without singularity when nuclear\nnumber $Z>137$, showing a reversed energy order pending for experimental tests\nsuch as Zeeman effects. In non-relativistic limit, this nonlinear equation\nreduces to nonlinear schr\\\"odinger equation with soliton-like solutions.\nMoreover, particle conjugation and electron-proton scattering with a\nnonsingular current-potential interaction are discussed. Finally the explicit\nform of gauge function is found, the uniqueness of Lorentz gauge is proven and\nthe Lagrangian density of quantum electrodynamics (QED) is revised as well.
