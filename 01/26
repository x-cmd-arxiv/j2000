We show that perfect Andreev scattering (i.e.\nzero normal scattering) at the Fermi energy can only be achieved by fine-tuning\njunction parameters. We also obtain exact results for the Josephson current,\nwhich is generally a smooth function of the superconducting phase difference\nexcept when the junction parameters are adjusted to give perfect Andreev\nscattering, in which case it becomes a sawtooth function. We then observe that,\neven when interactions are included, all low energy properties of a junction\n(E<<\\Delta, the superconducting gap) can be obtained by \"integrating out\" the\nsuperconducting electrons to obtain an effective Hamiltonian describing the\nmetallic electrons only with a boundary pairing interaction. This boundary\nmodel provides a suitable starting point for bosonization/renormalization\ngroup/boundary conformal field theory analysis. We argue that total normal\nreflection and total Andreev reflection correspond to two fixed points of the\nboundary renormalization group. For repulsive bulk interactions the Andreev\nfixed point is unstable and the normal one stable. However, the reverse is true\nfor attractive interactions. This implies that a generic junction Hamiltonian\n(without fine-tuned junction parameters) will renormalize to the normal fixed\npoint for repulsive interactions but to the Andreev one for attractive\ninteractions. An exact mapping of our tight-binding model to the Hubbard model\nwith a transverse magnetic field is used to help understand this behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2000 22:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The properties of the dark-state\npolaritons such as the group velocity are determined by the mixing angle\nbetween light and matter components and can be controlled by an external\ncoherent field as the pulse propagates. In particular, light pulses can be\ndecelerated and ``trapped'' in which case their shape and quantum state are\nmapped onto metastable collective states of matter. Possible applications of\nthis reversible coherent-control technique are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2000 08:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
