OO models of\nC++ and of a window system are however different. C++ was designed to be a\n\"static\" language with a lexical name scoping, static type checking and\nhierarchies defined at compile time. Screen objects on the other hand are\ninherently dynamic; they usually live well beyond the procedure/block that\ncreated them; the hierarchy of widgets is defined to a large extent by layout,\nvisibility and event flow. Many GUI fundamentals such as dynamic and geometric\nhierarchies of windows and controls, broadcasting and percolation of events are\nnot supported directly by C++ syntax or execution semantics (or supported as\n\"exceptions\" -- pun intended). Therefore these features have to be emulated in\nC++ GUI code. This leads to duplication of a graphical toolkit or a window\nmanager functionality, code bloat, engaging in unsafe practices and forgoing of\nmany strong C++ features (like scoping rules and compile-time type checking).\nThis paper enumerates a few major C++/GUI sores and illustrates them on simple\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2000 21:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These differences are attributed to the Dicke cooperativity in the\ntwo-atom system. We also show that the two-atom Dicke micromaser is equivalent\nto a one-atom cascade two-photon micromaser. With the introduction of a\none-photon detuning, the present theory further describes a true two-photon\nmicromaser. We discuss in detail the role of one-photon detuning in the\nmechanism of a one-atom two-photon micromaser. This leads us to point out that\nthe two-atom cavity dynamics can be verified by a proper scaling of the results\nfrom an equivalent one-atom two-photon micromaser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2000 06:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
