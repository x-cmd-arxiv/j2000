The speed at which wave groups propagate (group\nspeed) is shown to be the speed at which both modulated wave information and\nwave energy density propagate. Because of the similarity of the governing\npartial differential equations, two other physical systems (magnetic\noscillating dipole, and gravitational radiating oscillating mass) are noted to\nhave similar results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jan 2000 21:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\ndescribe the forced stochastically diverse circular oscillation motion, created\nby force of the electrical interaction of the SchEl's elementary electric\ncharge with the electric intensity of the resultant quantum electromagnetic\nfield of the existing StchVrtPhtns, as a solution of Abraham-Lorentz equation.\nBy dint of this equation we obtain that the smooth thin line of a classical\nmacro particle is rapidly broken of many short and disorderly orientated lines,\nowing the continuous dispersion of the quantum micro particle (QntMicrPrt) on\nthe StchVrtPhtns. Between two successive scattering the centers of diverse\ncircular oscillations with stochastically various radii are moving along this\nshort disordered line. These circular oscillations lie within the flats,\nperpendicular to same disordered short line, along which are moving its\ncenters. In a result of same forced circular oscillation motion the smooth thin\nline of the LrEl is roughly spread and turned out into some cylindrically wide\npath of the SchEl. Hence the dispersions of different dynamical parameters,\ndetermining the state of the SchEl, which are results of its continuously\ninteraction with the resultant quantum electromagnetic field of the\nStchVrtPhtns.
