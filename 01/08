Our results are compared to the\npotential-energy diagram for this reaction inferred from experimental data by\nHickman and Schmidt The calculations essentially reproduce the scheme of\nHickman and Schmidt for water formation on Rh(111) with the important\ndifference that the OH molecule is significantly more stable than assumed by\nHickman and Schmidt. On Pt(111) surfaces, however, the calculations predict a\nbarrier to OH formation very similar to that found on Rh(111). In particular,\nthe calculated barrier to OH formation of about 20 kcal/mol seems to contradict\nthe small 2.5 kcal/mol barrier assumed in the Hickman-Schmidt scheme and the\nobserved large rate of water formation on Pt. A possible explanation for the\napparent discrepancy between the large calculated barrier for OH formation on\nPt and the experimentally observed rapid formation of water even at low\ntemperatures is that the active sites for water formation on Pt are at \"defect\"\nsites and not on the ideally flat terraces. A similar conclusion has been\nreached by Verheij and Comsa, who did detailed experimental work on water\nformation on Pt surfaces. Analyzing our results, we develop an explicit picture\nof the interaction processes governing the formation of OH groups. This picture\nrationalizes the calculated weak dependence of OH formation on substrate\nmaterial.

One possibility is a spontaneous change of phase\nfrom a lower-energy vacuum state to one of higher energy, as exemplified by an\nasymmetric double-well potential with different masses in each well. If the\nlower well is in resonance with oscillations of the potential, a system can be\ndriven resonantly to the upper well and stay there (except for tunneling) if\nthe upper well is not resonant. Another example occurs in hybrid inflation\nmodels where the Higgs field is resonant; the Higgs oscillations can be\ntransferred to electroweak (EW) gauge potentials, leading to rapid transitions\nover sphaleron barriers and consequent B+L violation. Given an appropriate\nCP-violating seed, we find that preheating can drive a time-varying condensate\nof Chern-Simons number over large spatial scales; this condensate evolves by\noscillation as well as decay into modes with shorter spatial gradients,\neventually ending up as a condensate of sphalerons.
