Analysis of 5.7 years of photometry on 11.9 million stars in the LMC\nreveals 13 - 17 microlensing events. This is significantly more than the $\\sim$\n2 to 4 events expected from lensing by known stellar populations. The\ntimescales ($\\that$) of the events range from 34 to 230 days.

The spatial distribution of events is mildly inconsistent\nwith LMC/LMC disk self-lensing, but is consistent with an extended lens\ndistribution such as a Milky Way or LMC halo. Interpreted in the context of a\nGalactic dark matter halo, consisting partially of compact objects, a maximum\nlikelihood analysis gives a MACHO halo fraction of 20% for a typical halo model\nwith a 95% confidence interval of 8% to 50%. A 100% MACHO halo is ruled out at\nthe 95% C.L. for all except our most extreme halo model. Interpreted as a\nGalactic halo population, the most likely MACHO mass is between $ 0.15 \\msun$\nand $ 0.9 \\msun$, depending on the halo model, and the total mass in MACHOs out\nto 50 kpc is found to be 9+4-3 10^{10} msun, independent of the halo model.\nThese results are marginally consistent with our previous results, but are\nlower by about a factor of two.
