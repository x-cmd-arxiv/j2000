I discuss the nature,\nabundance and redshift distributions of objects detectable in ground-based\nsearches with state-of-the-art technology. An advantage of the SZ approach is\nthat the total SZ flux density depends only on the thermal energy of the\nintracluster gas and not on its spatial or temperature structure, in contrast\nto the X-ray luminosity. Because ground-based surveys will be characterized by\narcminute angular resolution, they will resolve a large fraction of the cluster\npopulation. I quantify the resulting consequences for the cluster selection\nfunction; these include less efficient cluster detection compared to idealized\npoint sources and corresponding steeper integrated source counts.

At a given flux density sensitivity and angular resolution, searches\nat millimeter wavelengths (bolometers) are more efficient than centimeter\nsearches (radio), due to the form of the SZ spectrum.
