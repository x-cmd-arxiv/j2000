I emphasize those observational\nand theoretical aspects that should interest the broad audience of this\nmeeting. The easily accessible timescales of the bursts (durations of tens of\nseconds and recurrence times of hours to days) allow for a very stringent\ncomparison to theory. The largest discrepancy (which was found with EXOSAT\nobservations) is the accretion rate dependence of the Type I burst properties.\nBursts become less frequent and energetic as the global accretion rate\nincreases, just the opposite of what the spherical theory predicts. I present a\nresolution of this issue by taking seriously the observed dependence of the\nburning area on the global accretion rate, which implies that as the accretion\nrate increases, the accretion rate per unit area decreases. This resurrects the\nunsolved problem of knowing where the freshly accreted material accumulates on\nthe star, equally relevant to the likely signs of rotation during the bursts\nsummarized by Swank at this meeting. I close by highlighting the Type I bursts\nfrom GS 1826-238 that were found with BeppoSAX and RXTE. Their energetics,\nrecurrence times and temporal profiles clearly indicate that hydrogen is being\nburned during these bursts, most likely by the rapid-proton (rp) process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2000 22:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
