The numerical experiments follow the formation of\ngalaxy-sized halos in two Cold Dark Matter dominated universes: the standard\nOmega=1 CDM scenario and the currently popular LCDM model. We find that the\nslope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher relation are well reproduced in\nthe simulations, although not, as proposed in recent work, as a result of the\ncosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity: large\nsystematic variations in the fraction of baryons that collapse to form galaxies\nand in the ratio between halo and disk circular velocities are observed in our\nnumerical experiments. The Tully-Fisher slope and scatter are recovered in this\nmodel as a direct result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly\nof the luminous component of the galaxy. We conclude that models that neglect\nthe self-gravity of the disk and its influence on the detailed structure of the\nhalo cannot be used to derive meaningful estimates of the scatter or slope of\nthe Tully-Fisher relation. Our models fail, however, to match the zero-point of\nthe Tully-Fisher relation, as well as that of the relation linking disk\nrotation speed and angular momentum. These failures can be traced,\nrespectively, to the excessive central concentration of dark halos formed in\nthe Cold Dark Matter cosmogonies we explore and to the formation of galaxy\ndisks as the final outcome of a sequence of merger events.

These micelles can be entangled with\neach other leading to viscoelastic phases. The rheological properties of such\nphases are very interesting and have been the subject of a large number of\nexperimental and theoretical studies in recent years. We shall report on our\nrecent work on the macrorheology, microrheology and nonlinear flow behaviour of\ndilute aqueous solutions of a surfactant CTAT (Cetyltrimethylammonium\nTosilate). This system forms elongated micelles and exhibits strong\nviscoelasticity at low concentrations ($\\sim$ 0.9 wt%) without the addition of\nelectrolytes. Microrheology measurements of $G(\\omega)$ have been done using\ndiffusing wave spectroscopy which will be compared with the conventional\nfrequency sweep measurements done using a cone and plate rheometer. The second\npart of the paper deals with the nonlinear rheology where the measured shear\nstress $\\sigma$ is a nonmonotonic function of the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$. In\nstress-controlled experiments, the shear stress shows a plateau for\n$\\dot{\\gamma}$ larger than some critical strain rate, similar to the earlier\nreports on CPyCl/NaSal system. Cates et al have proposed that the plateau is a\nsignature of mechanical instability in the form of shear bands. We have carried\nout extensive experiments under controlled strain rate conditions, to study the\ntime-dependence of shear stress. The measured time series of shear stress has\nbeen analysed in terms of correlation integrals and Lyapunov exponents to show\nunambiguously that the behaviour is typical of low dimensional dynamical\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jan 2000 13:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
