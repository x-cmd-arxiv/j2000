The release of the homogeneous IUE final archive and the\navailability of the high-accuracy Hipparcos parallaxes provide an opportunity\nto revisit this issue, as accurate stellar distances make it possible to\ncompare observed absolute fluxes with the predictions of model atmospheres.\n  The near-UV continuum is highly sensitive to Teff and [Fe/H], and once the\ngravity is constrained from the parallax, these parameters may be derived from\nthe analysis of low-dispersion \"long-wavelength\" (2000-3000 A) IUE spectra for\nstars previously studied by Alonso et al. (1996; A&AS 117, 227) using the\nInfrared Flux Method (IRFM). A second comparison is carried out against the\nstars spectroscopically investigated by Gratton et al. (1996; A&A 314, 191). It\nis shown that there is a good agreement between Teffs obtained from the IRFM\nand from the near-UV continuum, and a remarkable correspondence between\nobserved and synthetic fluxes for stars with 4000 <= Teff <= 6000 K of any\nmetallicity and gravity. These facts suggest that model atmospheres provide an\nadequate description of the near-UV continuum forming region and that the\nopacities involved are essentially understood. For cooler stars, the results of\nthe IRFM are no longer reliable, as shown by Alonso et al., but the discrepancy\nnoticed for stars hotter than 6000 K may reflect problems in the model\natmospheres and/or the opacities at these higher temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2000 17:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We provide an in-depth comparison between the MHD model\nand the Sy 1 galaxy NGC 5548, which at high spectral resolution exhibits a\nnumber of discrete UV absorption components. We find that: (1) the total column\ndensities of Ovii, Oviii and H, are reproduced by constraining the UV ion\ncolumn densities of Civ and Nv in each component to lie within a factor of 2 of\ntheir observed values and optimizing over the possible sets of component\nionization states and Civ column densities; (2) the WA exists in the outer part\nof the wind and is not a continuation of the flow in the BLR; and (3) the WA\nextends in radial and polar directions and is ionization-stratified. X-ray\nabsorption is found to be heavily biased towards smaller r, and UV absorption\noriginates at larger distances from the central continuum source. We show that\nthe discrete absorption components along the line-of-sight are intrinsically\nclumpy. Density differences between kinematic components result in a range of\nionization and recombination timescales. We further test the applicability of\nthe MHD wind to WAs in general, by constructing a quasi-continuous flow model,\nand extending it to arbitrary aspect angles. We estimate the fraction of Sy 1s\nhaving detectable WAs with larger Ovii column density than Oviii, and the range\nof total H column densities. We also find that the ratio of Ovii to Oviii\noptical depths can serve as a new diagnostic of AGN aspect angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jan 2000 00:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The evolution of the quantum state is\ngoverned by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial\nHamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian,\nwhose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system\nevolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big\nenough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the\ntwo lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate\nthis gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability\nproblem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in\nthese cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2000 22:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we show how\nthe formalism of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) provides a rigorous\nframework within which to analyze entanglement in the context of a fully\nrelativistic formulation of quantum theory. What emerges from the analysis are\nnew practical and theoretical limitations on an experimenter's ability to\nperform operations on a field in one spacetime region that can disentangle its\nstate from the state of the field in other spacelike-separated regions. These\nlimitations show just how deeply entrenched entanglement is in relativistic\nquantum field theory, and yield a fresh perspective on the ways in which the\ntheory differs conceptually from both standard nonrelativistic quantum theory\nand classical relativistic field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jan 2000 20:36:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
