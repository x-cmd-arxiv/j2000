Heat conduction from the hot cluster halo leads to\nevaporation of the relatively cooler galactic halos. The stellar distribution\nwould adiabatically expand as it readjusts to the loss of dark matter, reducing\nthe velocity dispersion and increasing the half-light radius. If the dark\nmatter content within that radius was f_dm = 25-50% of the total, as indicated\nby current observations, the ellipticals in clusters would be offset from the\nfundamental plane relation beyond the observational scatter. The requirement\nthat their halos survive for a Hubble time appears to exclude just that range\nof the dark matter cross-section, 0.3 < sigma/m < 10^4 cm^2/g, thought to be\noptimal for reducing central halo cusps, unless f_dm < 15%. If the\ncross-section is allowed to vary with the relative velocity of dark matter\nparticles, sigma \\propto v^{-2 delta}, a new problem of evaporation of dark\nmatter arises in the dwarf galaxies with low velocity dispersion. The halos of\nlarge galaxies in clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Group can both\nsurvive only if delta < 1.1 or delta > 1.8.

Although a\ncomplete solution of either of these problems is out of the question at this\ntime, we give here some handy and useful invariants of isomorphic as well as of\nequivalent varieties. Furthermore, and more importantly, we give a universal\nprocedure for obtaining all possible algebraic varieties isomorphic to a given\none, and use it to construct numerous examples of isomorphic, but inequivalent\nalgebraic varieties in ${\\bf C}^n$.\n  Among other things, we establish the following interesting fact: for\nisomorphic hypersurfaces $\\{p(x_1,...,x_n)=0\\}$ and $\\{q(x_1,...,x_n)=0\\}$, the\nnumber of zeros of $grad(p)$ might be different from that of $grad(q)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2000 14:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

The open charm cross sections from $pN$ and $\\pi N$ reactions are\nfitted to results from PYTHIA and scaled in magnitude to the available\nexperimental data.
