Earlier, we showed that the sub-mm radiation from this source\nmay be associated with thermal synchrotron emission from an inner Keplerian\nregion within the circularization radius of the accreting plasma. In this\npaper, we extend this analysis in a very important way, by calculating the\nimplied high-energy emission of Sgr A* associated with the orbiting, hot,\nmagnetized gas. We find that for the accretion rate inferred from the fits to\nthe sub-mm data, the dominant contribution to Sgr A*'s X-ray flux is due to\nself-Comptonization of the radio photons, rather than from bremsstrahlung. The\nlatter is a two-body process, which would produce significant X-ray emission\nonly at much higher accretion rates. This picture leads to the testable\nprediction that the physical conditions within the inner $\\sim5r_S$ are\nvariable on a time scale of order a year. In particular, the accretion rate\n$\\dot M$ appears to have changed by about 15% between the sub-mm measurements\nin 1996 and 1999. Given that the radio and self-Comptonized fluxes are strongly\ncorrelated in this picture, the upcoming second generation Chandra observations\nof Sgr A* may provide the direct evidence required to test this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2000 20:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2000 00:22:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 May 2002 17:53:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

While the X-ray image of the\ncluster exhibits complex structure in the central region as reported in\nMcNamara $etal$, the large scale X-ray morphology of the cluster is fairly\nsmooth. A spectroscopic analysis of the ACIS data shows that the gas\ntemperature in Hydra A increases outward, reaches a maximum temperature of 4\nkeV at 200 kpc, and then decreases slightly at larger radii. The distribution\nof heavy elements is nonuniform, with a factor of two increase in the Fe and Si\nabundances within the central 100 kpc. Beyond the central 100 kpc the Si-to-Fe\nabundance ratio is twice solar, while the Si-to-Fe ratio of the central excess\nis consistent with the solar value. One of the more surprising results is the\nlack of spectroscopic evidence for multiphase gas within the bulk of the\ncooling flow. Beyond the central 30 kpc, the ACIS spectra are adequately fit\nwith a single temperature model. The addition of a cooling flow component does\nnot significantly improve the fit. Only within the central 30 kpc (where the\ncooling time is less than 1~Gyr), is there spectroscopic evidence for\nmultiphase gas. However, the spectroscopic mass deposition rate is more than a\nfactor of 10 less than the morphologically derived mass accretion rate at 30\nkpc.

The\noutflow velocities of the clouds range from -200 to -1200 km/s and from -3400\nto -5200 km/s, respectively. The width of the individual absorption lines\nranges from 50 to more than 1000 km/s. The most prominent absorption lines are\nthose of Mg II, Mg I, and Fe II. The low ionization absorption lines occur at\nthe same velocities as the most saturated Mg II lines, showing that the Fe II,\nMg I and Mg II line forming regions must be closely associated.

From this we determine an\nelectron density in the Fe II line forming regions of 4000 per cubic cm.\nModelling the ionization state of the absorbing gas with this value of the\nelectron density as a constraint, we find that the distance between the Fe II\nand Mg I line forming region and the continuum source is of order 700 parsec.\n  From the correspondence in velocity between the Fe II, Mg I and Mg II lines\nwe infer that the Mg II lines must be formed at the same distance.

These\nobjects are interpreted as hybrid mesons, in the quark-gluon constituent model\nusing a chromoharmonic confining potentiel.\n  The quantum numbers $J^{PC}I^{G} = 1^{-+} 1^{-}$ can be considered in a\nconstituent model as an hybrid meson ($q \\bar q g$). The lowest $J^{PC}=\n1^{-+}$states may be built in two ways : $l_{g}$=1 (gluon-excited)\ncorresponding to an angular momentum between the gluon and ($q \\bar q$) system,\nwhile $l_{q \\bar q}=1$ (quarks-excited) corresponds to an angular momentum\nbetween $q$ and $\\bar q$. For the gluon-excited mode $1^{-+}$ hybrids, we find\nthe decay dominated by the $b_{1}\\pi$ channel, and by the $\\rho \\pi$ channel\nfor the quark-excited mode. In our model, neither the quark-excited nor the\ngluon-excited $1^{-+}$ (1400 MeV) hybrids can decay into $\\eta\\pi$ and\n$\\eta'\\pi$, in contradiction with experiment. Hence, the 1400 MeV resonance\nseems unlikely to be an hybrid state. The $1^{-+}$ (1600 MeV) gluon-excited\nhybrid is predicted with too large a total decay width, to be considered as an\nhybrid candidate. On the contrary the quark-excited mode has a total decay\nwidth around 165 MeV, with a $\\rho \\pi$ preferred decay channel, in agreement\nwith BNL.

However, the theoretical basis for such claims\nis usually taken to be Bell's Theorem, which shows only that if certain\npredictions of quantum theory are correct, and a strong hidden-variable\nassumption is valid, then a certain locality condition must fail. This locality\ncondition expresses the idea that what an experimenter freely chooses to\nmeasure in one spacetime region can have no effect of any kind in a second\nregion situated spacelike relative to the first. The experimental results\nconform closely to the predictions of quantum theory in such cases, but the\nmost reasonable conclusion to draw is not that locality fails, but rather that\nthe hidden-variable assumption is false. For this assumption conflicts with the\nquantum precept that unperformed experiments have no outcomes.
