In particular, we show that the blowup function\nin Donaldson-Witten theory, up to a redefinition of the fast times, is a tau\nfunction for a g-gap solution of the KdV hierarchy. In the case of\nfour-manifolds of simple type, instead, the blowup function becomes a tau\nfunction corresponding to a multisoliton solution. We obtain a new expression\nfor the contact terms that links these results to the Whitham hierarchy\nformulation of Seiberg-Witten theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2000 21:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The energy arising between two nearly perfectly\nconducting parallel plates is shown to become increasingly negative as the\nplate separation is reduced. It is proposed that the Casimir energy appears\nincreasingly negative simply because the vacuum electromagnetic zero-point\nfield performs positive work in pushing the plates together, transforming field\nenergy into kinetic energy of the plates. Next, the inertial properties of\nexotic matter are considered. The parallel plates of the Casimir system are\nreplaced with an enclosed cavity of identical dimensions that is subjected to\nan external force. It is found that zero-point radiation exerts an inertial\nforce on the cavity in opposition to the external force. This ultimately leads\nto the conclusion that the inertial properties of exotic matter are identical\nto the inertial properties of ordinary matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2000 15:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2001 17:54:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Sep 2001 16:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In\nthis paper we discuss the general problem of distilling maximally entangled\nstates from $N$ copies of a bipartite quantum system about which only partial\ninformation is known, for instance in the form of a given expectation value. We\npoint out that there is indeed a problem with applying the Jaynes principle of\nmaximum entropy to more than one copy of a system, but the nature of this\nproblem is classical and was discussed extensively by Jaynes. Under the\nadditional assumption that the state $\\rho^{(N)}$ of the $N$ copies of the\nquantum system is exchangeable, one can write down a simple general expression\nfor $\\rho^{(N)}$. We show how to modify two standard entanglement purification\nprotocols, one-way hashing and recurrence, so that they can be applied to\nexchangeable states. We thus give an explicit algorithm for distilling\nentanglement from an unknown or partially known quantum state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2000 19:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
