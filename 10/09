We find that the X-ray dips are\nnot present during the BeppoSAX observation, in line with recent RXTE results.\nThe broad band (0.1-100 keV) energy spectrum is well fitted by a\nthree-component model consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody with an inner\ndisk temperature of ~0.85 keV, a comptonized spectrum with an electron\ntemperature of ~2 keV, and a bremsstrahlung at a temperature of ~20 keV.\nAdopting a distance of 10 kpc and taking into account a spectral hardening\nfactor of ~1.7 (because of electron scattering which modifies the blackbody\nspectrum emitted by the disk) we estimated that the inner disk radius is\n$R_{\\rm in} \\sqrt{\\cos i} \\sim 11$ km, where i is the inclination angle of the\nsystem with respect to the line of sight. The comptonized component could\noriginate in a spherical corona or boundary layer, surrounding the neutron\nstar, with optical depth ~19. The bremsstrahlung emission, contributing ~4% of\nthe total luminosity, probably originates in an extended accretion disk corona\nwith radius $\\sim 10^{10}$ cm.

This last component might also be present in other\nlow mass X-ray binaries, but, because of its low intrinsic luminosity, it is\nnot easily observable. We also find an absorption edge at ~1.27 keV with an\noptical depth of ~0.15. Its energy could correspond to the L-edge of Fe XVII,\nor K-edge of Ne X or neutral Mg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2000 09:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This\nresult has been used to obtain interesting relations between the various terms\nin the gravitational part of the boundary effective action, in particular the\nterm that affect the cosmological constant. It is found that once the\ncosmological constant is cancelled in the UV theory, the RG-flow symmetry of\nthe boundary effective action automatically implies the existence of zero\ncosmological constant solutions that extend all the way into the IR. Given the\nstandard (and well founded) contradiction between the RG-flow idea and the\nobservational evidence of a small cosmological constant, this is considered to\nbe an important progress, albeit incomplete, towards the final solution.\nMotivated by this success, it would be interesting to see whether this\nRG-stability extends outside the scope of strong 't Hooft coupling and large N\nregime that are implicitly assumed in the de Boer-Verlinde-Verlinde\nHamilton-Jacobi formulation of the holographic RG-flow equations of the\nboundary theory.

In particular, a complete toric description\nof fibers - both generic and non-generic -, image, and the flattening\nstratification of a toric morphism are given. Two examples are provided to\nillustrate the discussions. We then turn to the study of the restriction of a\ntoric morphism to a toric hypersurface. The details of this can be understood\nby the various restrictions of a line bundle with a section that defines the\nhypersurface. These general toric geometry discussions give rise to a\ncomputational scheme for the details of a toric morphism and the induced\nfibration of toric hypersurfaces therein. We apply this scheme to study the\nfamily of 4-dimensional elliptic Calabi-Yau toric hypersurfaces that appear in\na recent work of Braun-Candelas-dlOssa-Grassi.

It is shown that for low\ncollision energies possible nuclear reactions (including deuterium fusion) are\nstrongly boosted by the environment. The effect originates from a chain of\npreliminary three elastic collisions which transform the projectile-target\nexperiment into one with colliding beams. Firstly, the projectile-target pair\nof nuclei undergo elastic scattering in which the projectile shares its energy\nand momentum with the target nucleus. Then the projectile and target nuclei\ncollide with different heavy nuclei from the environment. These latter\ncollisions change the velocities of the target and projectile nuclei and set\nthem again on the collision course. Finally, the same pair of nuclei collide\ninelastically, this time giving rise to the nuclear reaction. The increased\nenergy of the target nucleus increases the relative velocity up to sqrt 2\ntimes, resulting in a drastic exponential increase of the probability to\npenetrate the Coulomb barrier and therefore sharply increasing the likelihood\nof the nuclear reaction. Applications to laser-induced fusion are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2000 00:47:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2001 07:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This effectively\nconverts the fixed target process into a colliding beam reaction. In a simple\nlimiting case this reduces the negative penetrability exponent by a factor of\n$\\sqrt{2}$.
