We work\nin isotropic coordinates where the wave equations have a simple managable form\nand do not make a weak gravitational field approximation. We interpret these\nwave equations in terms of a quantum mechanical particle moving in medium with\na spatially varying effective index of refraction. Due to the first order\nspatial derivative structure of the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, only\nthe spin 1/2 particle has \\textit{exactly} the quantum mechanical phase as\nindicated above. The second order spatial derivative structure of the spin 0\nand spin 1 wave equations yield the above phase only to lowest order in\n$\\hbar$. We develop a WKB approximation for the solution of the spin 0 and spin\n1 wave equations and explore amplitude and phase corrections beyond the lowest\norder in $\\hbar$. For the spin 1/2 particle we calculate the phase appropriate\nfor neutrino flavor oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2000 20:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

These correlations are manifested as the self-similar fractal\ngeometry of the global cloud cover pattern and the inverse power-law form for\nthe atmospheric eddy energy spectrum. Such long-range spaciotemporal\ncorrelations are ubiquitous in extended natural dynamical systems and are\nsignatures of deterministic chaos or self-organized criticality. In this paper,\na cell dynamical system model for atmospheric flows is developed by\nconsideration of microscopic domain eddy dynamical processes. This\nnondeterministic model enables formulation of a simple closed set of governing\nequations for the prediction and description of observed atmospheric flow\nstructure characteristics as follows. The strange-attractor design of the field\nof deterministic chaos in atmospheric flows consists of a nested continuum of\nlogarithmic spiral circulations that trace out the quasi-periodic Penrose\ntiling pattern, identified as the quasi-crystalline structure in condensed\nmatter physics. The atmospheric eddy energy structure follows laws similar to\nquantum mechanical laws. The apparent wave-particle duality that characterize\nquantum mechanical laws is attributed to the bimodal phenomenological form of\nenergy display in the bidirectional energy flow that is intrinsic to eddy\ncirculations, e.g., formation of clouds in updrafts and dissipation of clouds\nin downdrafts that result in the observed discrete cellular geometry of cloud\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2000 07:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
