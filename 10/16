The ratios involving $\\bar{B}^0\\to D_s^-D^{+}$ mode have\nconsiderable penguin corrections ($\\sim 15%$ at the amplitude level), but those\ninvolving $\\bar{B}^0\\to D_s^-D^{*+}$ mode have relatively small penguin\ncorrections. On the other hand, the $\\bar{B}^0\\to D_s^-D^{+}$ mode has smaller\nform-factor dependance. Therefore, these ratios complement each other in\nmeasuring $\\vub/\\vcb$. The theoretical uncertainty from the hadronic form\nfactors in our method is at the level of 15%, which is comparable to the\nmodel-dependence uncertainty of about 20% in the measurement of $| \\vub/\\vcb |$\nfrom the exclusive semileptonic B decays. Using the newest upper limit on $B\\to\nD_s \\pi$ decay from CLEO, our method sets an upper limit $| \\vub/\\vcb | < 0.13$\nwhich is very close to the measured values from the semileptonic B decays. We\nalso discuss the possible breaking of factorization assumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2000 07:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-23"}

The background\nof the model is the concept of two preference relations determining Subject\nbehaviour. These are an \"internal\" or subjective preference relation and an\n\"external\" or objective preference relation.\n  The first (internal) preference relation is defined by some partial order on\na set of states of the Subject. The second (external) preference relation on\nthe state set is defined by a mapping from the state set to another partially\nordered set. The mapping will be called evaluation mapping (function).\n  We research the process of external preference maximization in a fashion that\nuses the external preference as little as possible. On the contrary, Subject\nmay use the internal preference without any restriction.\n  The complexity of a maximization procedure depends on the disagreement\nbetween these preferences. To solve the problem we apply some kind of the\nsuccessive approximations methods. In terms of evaluation mappings this method\noperates on a decomposition of the mapping into a superposition of several\nstandard operations and \"easy\" mappings (see the details below). Obtained in\nsuch way superpositions are called approximating forms.\n  We construct several such forms and present two applications. One of them is\nconcerned with a hypothetic origin of logic. The other application provides a\nnew interpretation of the well known model of human choice by Lefebvre. The\ninterpretation seems to suggest a justification different from the one proposed\nby Lefebvre himself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2000 06:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The advecting velocity field is\nGaussian, $\\delta$-correlated in time, and scales with a positive exponent\n$\\epsilon$. Explicit inertial-range expressions for the scalar correlation\nfunctions are obtained; they are represented by superpositions of power laws\nwith nonuniversal amplitudes and universal (dependent only on $\\epsilon$ and\n$\\alpha$, the compressibility parameter) anomalous exponents. The complete set\nof anomalous exponents for the pair correlation functions is found\nnonperturbatively, in any space dimension d, using the zero-mode technique. For\nhigher-order correlation functions, the anomalous exponents are calculated to\n$O(\\epsilon^{2})$ using the renormalization group. Like in the incompressible\ncase, the exponents exhibit a hierarchy related to the degree of anisotropy:\nthe leading contributions to the even correlation functions are given by the\nexponents from the isotropic shell, in agreement with the idea of restored\nsmall-scale isotropy. As the degree of compressibility increases, the\ncorrections become closer to the leading terms. The small-scale anisotropy\nreveals itself in the odd ratios of correlation functions: the skewness factor\nis slowly decreasing going down to small scales for the incompressible case,\nbut becomes increasing if $\\alpha$ is large enough. The higher odd\ndimensionless ratios (hyperskewness etc.) increase, thus signalling the\npersistent small-scale anisotropy; this effect becomes more pronounced for\nlarger values of $\\alpha$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2000 14:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
