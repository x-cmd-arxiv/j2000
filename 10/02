For both geometries we show how the conditions for observing\ncritical (continuous) filling are much less restrictive than for critical\nwetting, which is known to require fine tuning of the Hamaker constants. Wedge\nfilling is critical if the wetting binding potential does not exhibit a local\nmaximum, whilst conic filling is critical if the integrated strength of the\npotential is attractive. This latter scenario is particularly encouraging for\nfuture experimental studies. Using mean-field and effective Hamiltonian\napproaches, which allow for breather-mode fluctuations which translate the\ninterface up and down the sides of the confining geometry, we are able to\ncompletely classify the possible critical behaviour (for purely thermal\ndisorder). For the three dimensional wedge, the interfacial fluctuations are\nvery strong and characterised by a universal roughness critical exponent\n$\\nu_{\\perp} =1/4$ independent of the range of the forces.

Two examples are\nhistorically relevant as a motivation: If $w=1$, this corresponds to the study\nof the boundedness $M:L^p(u)\\longrightarrow L^p(u),$ which was characterized by\nB. Muckenhoupt, giving rise to the so called $A_p$ weights. The second case is\nwhen we take $u=1$. This is a more recent theory, and was completely solved by\nM.A. Ari\\~no and B. Muckenhoupt in 1991. It turns out that the boundedness\n$M:\\llo\\longrightarrow\\llo,$ can be seen to be equivalent to the boundedness of\nthe Hardy operator $A$ restricted to decreasing functions of $L^p(w)$. The\nclass of weights satisfying this boundedness is known as $B_p$. Even though the\n$A_p$ and $B_p$ classes enjoy some similar features, they come from very\ndifferent theories, and so are the techniques used on each case:\nCalder\\'on--Zygmund decompositions and covering lemmas for $A_p$, rearrangement\ninvariant properties and positive integral operators for $B_p$. It is our aim\nto give a unified version of these two theories. Contrary to what one could\nexpect, the solution is not given in terms of the limiting cases above\nconsidered (i.e., $u=1$ and $w=1$), but in a rather more complicated condition,\nwhich reflects the difficulty of estimating the distribution function of the\nHardy-Littlewood maximal operator with respect to general measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2000 12:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The potential $\\bar v$ fits very well the\nmeasured $\\bar p p$ annihilation cross sections at low energies ($p_L < 200$\nMeV/c) and the $1s$ and $2p$ spin-averaged level shifts and widths for the\n$\\bar p$H atom. The density-folded optical potential $V_{{\\rm opt}}$ reproduces\nsatisfactorily the strong-interaction level shifts and widths over the entire\nperiodic table, for $A > 10$, as well as the few low energy $\\bar p$\nannihilation cross sections measured on Ne. Both $\\bar v$ and $V_{{\\rm opt}}$\nare found to be highly absorptive, which leads to a saturation of reaction\ncross sections in hydrogen and on nuclei. Predictions are made for $\\bar p$\nannihilation cross sections over the entire periodic table at these very low\nenergies and the systematics of the calculated cross sections as function of\n$A$, $Z$ and $E$ is discussed and explained in terms of a Coulomb-modified\nstrong-absorption model. Finally, optical potentials which fit simultaneously\nlow-energy $\\bar p - ^4$He observables for $E < 0$ as well as for $E > 0$ are\nused to assess the reliability of extracting Coulomb modified $\\bar p$ nuclear\nscattering lengths directly from the data. The relationship between different\nkinds of scattering lengths is discussed and previously published systematics\nof the $\\bar p$ nuclear scattering lengths is updated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2000 08:25:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2000 07:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

A virtual pion beam, generated\nthrough an NN -> d pi reaction on one of the nucleons in the deuteron, produces\na second pion via a pi N -> pi pi N reaction on the other nucleon. Using the\nsame scale factor as for heavy meson production, the model reproduces the total\npi^0 pi^0 production rate determined at an excess energy of 37 MeV. There are\nsome indications in the data for a suppression of events with low pi pi masses,\nas in the pi^- p -> pi^0 pi^0 n reaction, and this is confirmed within the\nmodel. The model suggests that a significant fraction of the charged pion\nproduction in the p d -> 3He pi^+ pi^- reaction at Q=70 MeV might be associated\nwith isoscalar pion pairs, though this does not explain the strong dependence\nobserved on the pi^+ pi^- relative momentum angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2000 10:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We find that\nthe newly created resonance states are scarred on unstable periodic orbits of\nthe classical motion. The behavior of these periodic orbits as the field\nstrength is increased may explain why there are more resonance states at high\nfield strengths than at low field strengths. Close examination of an avoided\ncrossing between resonance states shows that this type of avoided crossing does\nnot delocalize the resonance states, although it may lead to interesting\neffects at certain field strengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2000 22:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
