It is also\nknown that the binding energy of the nascent hot SS is likely to be radiated as\n$\\nu -\\bar\\nu$s so that an electromagnetic pair fireball (FB) may be created by\nneutrino annihilation. And already this process has been considered as a\nprobable source of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) by several authors, the most notable\nof which is due to Cheng & Dai (PRL, 77, 1210, 1996). They mentioned that this\nprocess may generate a FB luminosity (outside the neutrinosphere) of 10**(49)\nerg. But we point out here that a SS is a relativistic object with surface\ngravitation z=0.5. Accordingly, we present here a Relativistic Model of this\nprocess, and show that, for a massive SS with M=2 solar mass, one may explain a\nGRB energy of ~ 10**(53) erg., which is 4 orders higher than previous\nnon-relativistic estimate. Further since the baryonic mass of the thin crust of\na strange star is negligible, this FB will generate an extremely relativistic\nblast wave. Thus this process may be one of the viable routes for the genesis\nof hitherto unexplained cosmic Gamma Ray Bursts. While some of the GRBs might\nbe beamed, many of them do not show any long term spectral break in their\nafterglows and are likely to be quasi-spherical.

These measurements are quite sensitive to experimental\ninaccuracies, especially time delays and inefficient detectors.
