The spectra of both sources are reasonably well-fit\nusing a model consisting of a disk-blackbody, a comptonized component and a Fe\nline, absorbed by interstellar absorption. The electron temperature (kT$_{\\rm\ne}$) of the Comptonizing plasma is in both cases $\\sim$2.5 keV. This implies\nthat no strong high-energy tail from the Comptonized component is present in\neither of the sources. We discuss the similarities between these burst sources\nand the luminous X-ray sources located in globular clusters.

We observe\nthat there exist Apollonian packings which have strong integrality properties,\nin which all circles in the packing have integer curvatures and rational\ncenters such that (curvature)$\\times$(center) is an integer vector. This series\nof papers explain such properties. A {\\em Descartes configuration} is a set of\nfour mutually tangent circles with disjoint interiors. We describe the space of\nall Descartes configurations using a coordinate system $\\sM_\\DD$ consisting of\nthose $4 \\times 4$ real matrices $\\bW$ with $\\bW^T \\bQ_{D} \\bW = \\bQ_{W}$ where\n$\\bQ_D$ is the matrix of the Descartes quadratic form $Q_D= x_1^2 + x_2^2+\nx_3^2 + x_4^2 -{1/2}(x_1 +x_2 +x_3 + x_4)^2$ and $\\bQ_W$ of the quadratic form\n$Q_W = -8x_1x_2 + 2x_3^2 + 2x_4^2$. There are natural group actions on the\nparameter space $\\sM_\\DD$. We observe that the Descartes configurations in each\nApollonian packing form an orbit under a certain finitely generated discrete\ngroup, the {\\em Apollonian group}. This group consists of $4 \\times 4$ integer\nmatrices, and its integrality properties lead to the integrality properties\nobserved in some Apollonian circle packings. We introduce two more related\nfinitely generated groups, the dual Apollonian group and the super-Apollonian\ngroup, which have nice geometrically interpretations. We show these groups are\nhyperbolic Coxeter groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2000 15:47:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2001 20:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2004 17:19:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2004 16:02:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2005 17:30:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
