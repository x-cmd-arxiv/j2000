We point out that these models (computed using spherical geometry)\npredict a limb darkening behaviour that deviates significantly from a simple\nlinear or two-parameter law (there is less intensity at the limb of the star).\nThe presence of a significantly nonlinear limb darkening law has two main\nconsequences. First, the ellipsoidal light curve computed for a tidally\ndistorted giant using the NEXTGEN intensities is in general different from the\nlight curve computed using the same geometry but with the black body\napproximation and a one- or two-parameter limb darkening law. In most cases the\nlight curves computed with the NEXTGEN intensities have deeper minima than\ntheir black body counterparts. Thus the light curve solutions for binaries with\na giant component obtained with models with near linear limb darkening (either\nblack body or plane-parallel model atmosphere intensities) are biased.\nObservations over a wide wavelength range (i.e. both the optical and infrared)\nare particularly useful in discriminating between models with nearly linear\nlimb darkening and the NEXTGEN models. Second, we show that rotational\nbroadening kernels for Roche lobe filling (or nearly filling) giants can be\nsignificantly different from analytic kernels due to a combination of the\nnonspherical shape of the star and the radical departure from a simple limb\ndarkening law. As a result, geometrical information inferred from V_rot*sin(i)\nmeasurements of cool giants in binary systems are likewise biased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2000 15:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This observation has been at the heart of many developments in\nbrane physics, including the construction of intersecting branes and reduced\nsymmetry D-brane configurations corresponding to the Coulomb branch of the\ngauge theory. However the search for multi-center solutions to gauged\nsupergravities has proven rather elusive. Because of the background curvature,\nit appears such solutions cannot be static. Nevertheless even allowing for time\ndependence, general multi-center solutions to gauged supergravity have yet to\nbe constructed. In this letter we investigate the construction of such\nsolutions for the case of D=5, N=2 gauged supergravity coupled to an arbitrary\nnumber of vector multiplets. Formally, we find a family of time dependent\nmulti-center black hole solutions which are easily generalized to the case of\nAdS supergravities in general dimensions. While these are not true solutions,\nas they have a complex metric and gauge potential, they may be related to a\nWick rotated theory or to a theory where the coupling is taken to be imaginary.\nThese solutions thus provide a partial realization of true multi-center\nblack-holes in gauged supergravities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2000 22:54:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2000 23:18:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
