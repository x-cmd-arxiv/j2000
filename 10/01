The image quality (half arcsec seeing) and depth of the VLT images\nallow the shear signal to be mapped with high signal-to-noise and to be traced\nout to 1.2 h_50^-1 Mpc, near the edge of the 6'.8x6'.8 field of view. Using\nBVRI color information, as well as 81 redshifts in the field from the CNOC\nsurvey, background galaxies can be effectively separated from cluster and\nforeground objects. PSF distorsions are found to be moderate across the FORS\nimages and thus easily removed. Due to the small statistical errors in the mass\nreconstruction, this dataset provides a testing ground where several systematic\neffects (e.g. mass-sheet degeneracy, redshift distribution of the background\nsources, cluster galaxy contamination) can be quantified. Several methods are\nused to remove the mass-sheet degeneracy which is found to dominate the\nsystematic error budget. We measure a lower limit to the mass of 2.6 10^14\nh_50^-1 M_sun within 1 h_50^-1 Mpc and a ``total'' mass of 5.3 10^14 h_50^-1\nM_sun by fitting a softened isothermal sphere. The availability of the CNOC\nredshift data and X-ray observations on this cluster allow a comparison of\ndifferent determinations of the mass radial profile. We find the lensing and\nX-ray measurements in excellent agreement, while the mass derived from the\nvirial analysis is marginally (1-2 sigma) in agreement at radii where both\nmethods are reliable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Sep 2000 17:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Strong\nSiO emission observed at ~50\" east of the IRAS source presents evidence for a\ndynamical interaction between a part of the eastern blue lobe and the dense\nambient gas condensation, however, such an interaction is unlikely to be\nresponsible for producing the quadrupolar morphology. The SiO emission in the\nnortheastern red lobe shows the spatial and velocity structure similar to those\nof the CO outflow, suggesting that the SiO emission comes from the molecular\noutflow in the northeastern red lobe itself. The observed velocity structure is\nreproduced by a simple spatio-kinematic model of bow shock with a shock\nvelocity of 19-24 km/s inclined by 30-45 deg from the plane of the sky.

The\nresultant N-body Hamiltonian is relativistically covariant. It can be easily\nseparated in terms of the center-of-mass and the relative motion of any\ntwo-body subsystem. It can also be separated into an unperturbed Hamiltonian\nwith a residual interaction. In a system of two-body composite particles, the\nsolutions of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are relativistic two-body internal\nstates, each of which can be obtained by solving a relativistic\nSchr\\\"odinger-like equation. The resultant two-body wave functions can be used\nas basis states to evaluate reaction matrix elements in the general N-body\nproblem. We prove a relativistic version of the post-prior equivalence which\nguarantees a unique evaluation of the reaction matrix element, independent of\nthe ways of separating the Hamiltonian into unperturbed and residual\ninteractions. Since an arbitrary reaction matrix element involves composite\nparticles in motion, we show explicitly how such matrix elements can be\nevaluated in terms of the wave functions of the composite particles and the\nrelevant Lorentz transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2000 02:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

A consequence for accelerating structures is that,\nwhen such plasma spots are present, they erode the copper surface at a rate on\nthe order of 300 micrograms per Coulomb of ion bombardment current.
