However,\nunlike the WF, the minimization is carried out with the added constraint of an\nunbiased reconstructed mean field. The new estimator does not necessitate a\nnoise model to estimate the underlying field; however, such a model is required\nfor evaluating the errors at each point in space. The general application of\nthe UMV estimator is to predict the values of the reconstructed field in\nun-sampled regions of space (e.g., interpolation in the unobserved Zone of\nAvoidance), and to dynamically transform from one measured field to another\n(e.g., inversion of radial peculiar velocities to over-densities). Here, we\nprovide two very simple applications of the method. The first, is to recover a\n1D signal from noisy, convolved data with gaps, e.g., CMB time-ordered data.\nThe second application is a reconstruction of the density and 3D peculiar\nvelocity fields from mock SEcat galaxy peculiar velocity catalogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2000 12:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Dec 2001 11:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These corrections\ncome from multiple wrapping of the BPS (Euclidean) D2-branes around certain\n(BPS) Calabi-Yau 3-cycles, and they are known as the D-instantons. The exact\nuniversal hypermultiplet metric is governed by a quaternionic potential that\nsatisfies the SU(\\infty) Toda equation. The mechanism is proposed, which\nelevates any four-dimensional hyper-K\"ahler metric with a rotational isometry\nto the quaternionic metric of the same dimension. A generic separable solution\nto the Toda equation appears to be related to the Eguchi-Hanson metric, whereas\nanother solution originating from the Atiyah-Hitchin metric describes the\ngravitationally dressed (mixed) D-instantons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2000 08:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Feb 2001 19:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

As a result, mass matrices factorize leading to fermion\nmass hierarchy. A calculation to first order gives mixing (CKM and MNS)\nmatrices in general agreement with experiment.
