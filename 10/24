The simulations show that depending\nupon the initial density,there are two occasions for the fragmentation of\nprimordial filaments. If a filament has relatively low initial density, the\nradial contraction is slow due to less effective H2 cooling. This filament\ntends to fragment into dense clumps before the central density reaches\n$10^{8-9}$ cm$^{-3}$, where H2 cooling by three-body reactions is effective and\nthe fragment mass is more massive than some tens $M_\\odot$. In contrast, if a\nfilament is initially dense, the more effective H2 cooling with the help of\nthree-body reactions allows the filament to contract up to $n\\sim 10^{12}$\ncm$^{-3}$.

The specific heat anomaly resembles a mean-field transition and\nshows no hysteresis or latent heat. Cd2Os2O7 orders magnetically at the MIT.\nThe magnetization data is consistent with antiferromagnetic order, with a small\nparasitic ferromagnetic component. The Hall and Seebeck coefficients are\nconsistent with a semiconducting gap opening at the Fermi energy at the MIT. We\nhave also performed electronic structure calculations on Cd2Os2O7. These\ncalculations indicate that Cd2Os2O7 is metallic, with a sharp peak in the\ndensity of states at the Fermi energy. We intepret the data in terms of a\nSlater transition. In this scenario, the MIT is produced by a doubling of the\nunit cell due to the establishment of antiferromagnetic order. A Slater\ntransition-unlike a Mott transition-is predicted to be continuous, with a\nsemiconducting energy gap opening much like a BCS gap as the material is cooled\nbelow $T_{MIT}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2000 13:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Clearly, this formula requires amendments, as it predicts an\ninfinitely large monopole C_0, and a dipole moment C_1 only 6/2 times larger\nthan the quadrupole C_2, both predictions in conflict with observations. We\nrestore the terms omitted in the course of the derivation of this formula, and\narrive at a new expression. According to the corrected formula, the monopole\nmoment is finite and small, while the dipole moment is sensitive to\nshort-wavelength perturbations, and numerically much larger than the\nquadrupole, as one would expect on physical grounds.
