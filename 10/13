In the case of swelling, the density profile for\nintermediate times is parabolic and expands in space as t^{1/3}, as predicted\nby a Flory-like continuum theory. The dynamics slows down after a time \\propto\nN^2 when the chain becomes stretched, and the polymer gets stuck in metastable\n`zig-zag' configurations, from which it escapes through thermal activation. The\nsize of the polymer in the final stages is found to grow as \\sqrt{\\ln t}. In\nthe case of collapse, the chain very quickly (after a time of order unity)\nbreaks up into clusters of monomers (`pearls'). The evolution of the chain then\nproceeds through a slow growth of the size of these metastable clusters, again\nevolving as the logarithm of time. We enumerate the total number of metastable\nstates as a function of the extension of the chain, and deduce from this\ncomputation that the radius of the chain should decrease as 1/\\ln(\\ln t). We\ncompute the total number of metastable states with a given value of the energy,\nand find that the complexity is non zero for arbitrary low energies.

One therefore\nneeds accurate techniques for calculating this quantity. While the direct\nMonte-Carlo procedure consisting of randomly generating the fragments into the\nfreeze-out volume and counting the events with no overlapped fragments is\nnumerically affordable only for partitions with small $N$, the present paper\nproposes a Metropolis - type simulation which allows accurate evaluations of\nthe free volume even for cases with large $N$. This procedure is used for\ncalculating the available volume for various situations. Though globally this\nquantity has an exponential dependence on $N$, variations of orders of\nmagnitude for partitions with the same $N$ may be identified. A parametrization\nbased on the virial approximation adjusted with a calibration function,\ndescribing very well the variations of the free volume for different partitions\nhaving the same $N$ is proposed.
