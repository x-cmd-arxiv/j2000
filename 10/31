Detailed\nstudies are currently available for only 5 HH outflows (Beck-Winchatz et al.\\\n1996), due to the large observational and theoretical effort required to\ndetermine metal abundances in HH objects.\n  Information about metal abundances in more HH objects is badly needed. We\ntherefore use a very approximate method by introducing a \"characteristic\nnumber\", A_me, whose definition is based only on often observed line fluxes. We\nfind a good correlation between A_me and the Fe abundance for the 5\nwell-studied HH objects. We use this correlation to determine approximate\nvalues of the gas phase Fe abundance in 13 additional high excitation and in 3\nadditional low excitation HH objects.\n  Of the 16 high excitation HH objects studied, there are 6 which approximately\nagree with normal population I abundance (i.e., no depletion due to dust\nformation). The remaining 10 show some Fe gas phase depletion which never gets\nlarger than by a factor of 2.5. This result is in agreement with our\nqualitative expectations that fast shocks efficiently destroy dust grains. Of\nthe 5 low excitation HH objects studied, there are 4 which, unexpectedly, show\na normal population I abundance.

The HI absorption in\nthese objects is likely to come from a nuclear disk, as found for other\ngalaxies of this type. The low detection rate is consistent with the hypothesis\n(as suggested by optical and X-ray data) that the ``standard'' pc scale,\ngeometrically thick torus is not required in low-luminosity radio galaxies. In\nthe case of FR type-II powerful radio galaxies, no HI absorption has been\ndetected in broad line radio galaxies, while three out of four narrow-line\nradio galaxies have been detected (the one non-detection having quite a high\nupper limit). All these are compact or small radio galaxies. To first order\nthis is consistent with the predictions of the unified schemes, assuming that\nthe HI absorption is due to an obscuring torus.

The analysis is similar to earlier analyses of\nenergy relaxation induced by binary encounters between nearby stars and between\nstars and giant molecular clouds in that the perturbations are idealised as a\nsum of near-random events which can be modeled as diffusion and dynamical\nfriction. However, the analysis differs in one important respect: because the\ntime scale associated with these perturbations need not be short compared with\nthe characteristic dynamical time t_D for stars in the original galaxy, the\ndiffusion process cannot be modeled as resulting from a sequence of\ninstantaneous kicks, i.e., white noise. Instead, the diffusion is modeled as\nresulting from random kicks of finite duration, i.e., coloured noise\ncharacterised by a nonzero autocorrelation time t_c. A detailed analysis of\ncoloured noise generated by sampling an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process leads to a\nsimpling scaling in terms of t_c and an effective diffusion constant D.\nInterpreting D and t_c following early work by Chandrasekhar (1941) (the\n`nearest neighbour approximation') implies that, for realistic choices of\nparameter values, energy relaxation associated with an external environment\nand/or internal pulsations could be important on times short compared with the\nage of the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2000 15:09:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We\nstudy here four main transition rules. The more classical one, introduced by\nBrylawski (1973) induces a lattice structure $L_B (n)$ (called dominance\nordering) between decreasing partitions of a given integer n. We prove that a\nmore restrictive transition rule, called SPM rule, induces a natural partition\nof L_B (n) in suborders, each one associated to a fixed point for SPM rule. In\nthe second part, we extend the SPM rule in a natural way and obtain a model\ncalled Chip Firing Game (Goles and Kiwi, 1993). We prove that this new model\nhas interesting properties: the induced order is a lattice, a natural greedoid\ncan be associated to the model and it also defines a strongly convergent game.\nIn the last section, we generalize the SPM rule in another way and obtain other\nlattice structure parametrized by some t: L(n,t), which form for -n+2 <= t <= n\na decreasing sequence of lattices. For each t, we characterize the fixed point\nof L(n,t) and give the value of its maximal sized chain's lenght. We also note\nthat L(n,-n+2) is the lattice of all compositions of n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2000 14:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To achieve this, we consider the practical\nproblem of creating a coherent superposition state of several qubits.

This, in turn, has two practical implications: (i) the initial\nstate cannot be controlled; (ii) the temperature of the system must be reduced.\nThese factors, in addition to decoherence and sensitivity to errors, must be\nconsidered in the implementation of quantum computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2000 23:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 2002 20:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

A collusion of players cheats in the above way or tries to disrupt the\nprotocol, i.e., the collusion tries to abort the computation or leaks\ninformation to honest players.

I give an overview of the main approaches to quantum\nstate discrimination. Several strategies exist. In quantum hypothesis testing,\na quantum system is prepared in a member of a known, finite set of states, and\nthe aim is to guess which one with the minimum probability of error. Error free\ndiscrimination is also sometimes possible, if we allow for the possibility of\nobtaining inconclusive results. If no prior information about the state is\nprovided, then it is impractical to try to determine it exactly, and it must be\nestimated instead. In addition to reviewing these various strategies, I\ndescribe connections between state discrimination, the manipulation of quantum\nentanglement, and quantum cloning.
