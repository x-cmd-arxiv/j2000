Our evolutionary synthesis models are based on the code of\nCervino & Mas-Hesse (1994), which has been updated to include recent stellar\nevolution tracks, new stellar atmospheres for OB and WR stars, and\nnucleosynthetic yields from massive stars during hydrostatic burning phases and\nexplosive SN II and SN Ib events. The temporal evolution of 26Al and 60Fe\nproduction, the equivalent yield of 26Al per ionising O7 V star (yal), and\nother observables are predicted for a coeval population. We also employed our\nmodel to estimate the steady state nucleosynthesis of a population of solar\nmetallicity. To allow for a fully quantitative analysis of existing and future\nmulti-wavelength observations, we propose a Bayesian approach that allows the\ninclusion of IMF richness effects and observational uncertainties in the\nanalysis. In particular, a Monte Carlo technique is adopted to estimate\nprobability distributions for all observables of interest. We outline the\nprocedure of exploiting these distributions by applying our model to a fictive\nmassive star association. Applications to existing observations of the Cygnus\nand Vela regions will be discussed in companion papers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2000 16:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The low-density phase consists of Fe\nbubbles, created by the energy input from radioactive Co and Ni, surrounded by\ncompressed high-density metal-rich ejecta.

This model provides a description of\nthe Delta resonance and its interactions that respects electromagnetic gauge\ninvariance and invariance under contact transformations when finite width\neffects are incorporated. Following recent developments in the description of\nunstable gauge bosons, we use a complex mass scheme to introduce the finite\nwidth of the Delta^{++} without spoiling gauge invariance. The total cross\nsection of elastic \\pi^+p scattering, whose amplitude exhibits the resonant\nplus background structure of S-matrix theory, is used to fix the mass, width\nand strong coupling of the \\Delta resonance. The differential cross section of\nelastic scattering is found in very good agreement with experimental data. The\nmagnetic dipole moment of the Delta^{++}, \\mu_{Delta}, is left as the only\nadjustable parameter in radiative \\pi^+p scattering. From a fit to the most\nsensitive configurations for photon emission in this process, we obtain\n\\mu_{\\Delta} = (6.14 +-0.51)e/2m_p, in agreement with predictions based on the\nSU(6) quark model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2000 19:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2000 01:00:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2001 20:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The perturbation series exhibits a\nrich singularity structure in the Borel plane. Resummation methods are\npresented which appear to lead to consistent results even in problematic cases\nwhere isolated singularities or branch cuts are present on the positive and\nnegative real axis in the Borel plane. Two resummation prescriptions are\ncompared: (i) a variant of the Borel-Pade resummation method, with an\nadditional improvement due to utilization of the leading renormalon poles (for\na comprehensive discussion of renormalons see [M. Beneke, Phys. Rep. vol. 317,\np. 1 (1999)]), and (ii) a contour-improved combination of the Borel method with\nan analytic continuation by conformal mapping, and Pade approximations in the\nconformal variable.
