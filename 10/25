However high resolution X-ray\nspectra of several clusters from the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on\nXMM-Newton now show a soft X-ray spectrum inconsistent with a simple cooling\nflow. The main problem is a lack of the emission lines expected from gas\ncooling below 1--2 keV. Lines from gas at about 2--3 keV are observed, even in\na high temperature cluster such as A 1835, indicating that gas is cooling down\nto about 2--3 keV, but is not found at lower temperatures. Here we discuss\nseveral solutions to the problem; heating, mixing, differential absorption and\ninhomogeneous metallicity. Continuous or sporadic heating creates further\nproblems, including the targetting of the heat at the cooler gas and also the\nhigh total energy required. So far there is no clear observational evidence for\nwidespread heating, or shocks, in cluster cores, except in radio lobes which\noccupy only part of the volume. The implied ages of cooling flows are short, at\nabout 1 Gyr. Mixing. or absorption, of the cooling gas are other possibilities.\nAlternatively, if the metals in the intracluster medium are not uniformly\nspread but are clumped, then little line emission is expected from the gas\ncooling below 1 keV. The low metallicity part cools without line emission\nwhereas the strengths of the soft X-ray lines from the metal-rich gas depend on\nthe mass fraction of that gas and not on the abundance, since soft X-ray line\nemission dominates the cooling function below 2 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2000 11:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In this scenario, the matter ejected from\nthe equatorial surface of the star drifts outward because of the effect of\nviscosity, and forms the disk. For simplicity, we adopt the alpha-prescription\nfor the viscous stress, and assume the disk to be isothermal. Solving the\nresulting wind equations, we find that a transonic solution exists for any\nvalue of alpha. The sonic point is located at r>100R for plausible values of\nparameters, where R is the stellar radius. The sonic radius is smaller for\nhigher temperature and/or larger radiative force. We also find that the\ntopology of the sonic point is nodal for alpha>0.95, while it is of saddle type\nfor alpha<0.9. We expect that the sonic point in the former case is unstable,\nwhereas that in the latter case is stable. The outflow is highly subsonic in\nthe inner part of the disk. Roughly, the outflow velocity increases linearly\nwith r and the surface density decreases as r^{-2}. Interestingly, the disk is\nnear Keplerian in the inner subsonic region, while it is angular momentum\nconserving in the outer subsonic region and in the supersonic region.

From Dirac's sea concept and the\nquark confinement idea, we conjecture and then assume that the quarks (in the\nvacuum state) compose colorless particles (uud and udd, hereafter will be\ncalled the Lee Particles). Moreover, the Lee Particles lead in a natural way to\nthe construction - a body center cubic lattice in the vacuum. Consequently,\nthere exists a strong interaction periodic field with body center cubic\nperiodic symmetries and an electromagnetic interaction periodic field (from the\ncharged Lee Particles uud) with simple cubic periodic symmetries in the vacuum.\nIn terms of the energy band theory, using a point baryon approximation (i.e.,\nomitting the structure of the Lee Particles), and from the symmetries of the\nstrong interaction periodic field, we have deduced the intrinsic quantum\nnumbers (I, S, C, b, Q) of all baryons and a unified mass formula from which\nall baryon masses can be found. This theoretical baryon spectrum is in\naccordance with the experimental results in both intrinsic quantum numbers and\nmasses.
