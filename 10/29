If GRBs are related to the collapse of massive\nstars, one expects the GRB rate to be approximately proportional to the star\nformation rate. We found that these two rates have similar slopes at low\nredshift. This suggests that GRBs do indeed track the star formation rate of\nthe Universe, which in turn implies that the formation rate of massive stars\nthat produce GRBs is proportional to the total star formation rate. It also\nimplies that we might be able to use GRBs as a probe of the cosmic star\nformation rate at high redshift. We find that the cosmic star formation rate\ninferred from the variability-luminosity relation increases steeply with\nredshift at z > 3. This is in apparent contrast to what is derived from\nmeasurements of the cosmic star formation rate at high redshift from optical\nobservations of field galaxies, suggesting that much high-z star formation is\nbeing missed in the optical surveys, even after corrections for dust extinction\nhave been made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2000 11:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
