The TAURUS-2 Imaging Fabry-Perot Interferometer was\nused on the Anglo-Australian 3.9-m telescope to derive the two-dimensional\nvelocity field of the Halpha-emitting gas over the central arcminute of NGC\n2992. The complete two-dimensional coverage of the data combined with simple\nkinematic models of rotating axisymmetric disks allows us to differentiate the\noutflowing material from the line-emitting material associated with the\ngalactic disk. The kinematics of the disk component out to R = 3.0 kpc are well\nmodeled by pure circular rotation. The outflow component is distributed into\ntwo wide cones with opening angle of 125 -- 135 degrees and extending 2.8 kpc\n(18\") on both sides of the nucleus at nearly right angles to the disk kinematic\nmajor axis. The outflow on the SE side of the nucleus is made of two distinct\nkinematic components interpreted as the front and back walls of a cone. The\nazimuthal velocity gradient in the back-wall component reflects residual\nrotational motion which indicates either that the outflowing material was\nlifted from the disk or that the underlying galactic disk is contributing\nslightly to this component. A single outflow component is detected in the NW\ncone. The most likely energy source for this outflow is a hot bipolar thermal\nwind powered on sub-kpc scale by the AGN and diverted along the galaxy minor\naxis by the pressure gradient of the ISM in the host galaxy. The data are not\nconsistent with a starburst-driven wind or a collimated outflow powered by\nradio jets.
