Briegel (LMU Munich)","title":"Quantum computing via measurements only","comments":"4 pages, 2 figures","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  A quantum computer promises efficient processing of certain computational\ntasks that are intractable with classical computer technology. While basic\nprinciples of a quantum computer have been demonstrated in the laboratory,\nscalability of these systems to a large number of qubits, essential for\npractical applications such as the Shor algorithm, represents a formidable\nchallenge. Most of the current experiments are designed to implement sequences\nof highly controlled interactions between selected particles (qubits), thereby\nfollowing models of a quantum computer as a (sequential) network of quantum\nlogic gates. Here we propose a different model of a scalable quantum computer.\nIn our model, the entire resource for the quantum computation is provided\ninitially in form of a specific entangled state (a so-called cluster state) of\na large number of qubits. Information is then written onto the cluster,\nprocessed, and read out form the cluster by one-particle measurements only. The\nentangled state of the cluster thus serves as a universal substrate for any\nquantum computation. Cluster states can be created efficiently in any system\nwith a quantum Ising-type interaction (at very low temperatures) between\ntwo-state particles in a lattice configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2000 19:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
