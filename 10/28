In this paper, building on prior work by Seidel and\nLalonde, McDuff and Polterovich, we show that these bundles have interesting\ncohomological properties. In particular, for many bases $B$ (for example when\n$B$ is a sphere, a coadjoint orbit or a product of complex projective spaces)\nthe rational cohomology of $P$ is the tensor product of the cohomology of $B$\nwith that of $M$. As a consequence the natural action of the rational homology\n$H_k(\\Ham(M))$ on $H_*(M)$ is trivial for all $M$ and all $k > 0$.\n  Added: The erratum makes a small change to Theorem 1.1 concerning the\ncharacterization of Hamiltonian bundles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2000 22:25:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2001 11:24:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 Jul 2006 12:44:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
