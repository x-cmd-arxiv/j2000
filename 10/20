In the standard picture, beyond this boundary,\npulsars with low spin rates cannot accelerate particles above the stellar\nsurface to high enough energies to initiate pair cascades, and the pair\ncreation needed for radio emission is strongly suppressed. In this paper we\nexplore the possibility of another pulsar ``death line'' in the context of\npolar cap models, corresponding to high magnetic fields B in the upper portion\nof the period-period derivative diagram, a domain where few radio pulsars are\nobserved. The origin of this high B boundary, which may occur when B becomes\ncomparable to or exceeds $B_{\\rm cr} = 4.4 \\times 10^{13}$ Gauss, is also due\nto the suppression of magnetic pair creation, but primarily because of\nineffective competition with magnetic photon splitting. Threshold pair creation\nalso plays a prominent role in the suppression of cascades. We present Monte\nCarlo calculations of the pair yields in photon splitting/pair cascades which\nshow that, in the absence of scattering effects, pair production is effectively\nsuppressed, but only if all three modes of photon splitting allowed by QED are\noperating in high fields. This paper describes the probable shape and position\nof the new ``death line,'' above which pulsars are expected to be radio quiet,\nbut perhaps still X-ray and gamma-ray bright. The hypothesized existence of\nradio-quiet sources finds dramatic support in the recent discovery of\nultra-strong fields in Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars.\nGuidelines for moderate to high B pulsar searches at radio wavelengths and also\nin the soft and hard gamma-ray bands are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2000 18:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These observations can be understood in the context of models in\nwhich post-primordial Li evolution during the halo and old-disk epochs is\ndominated by Galactic cosmic ray fusion and spallation reactions, with some\ncontribution from the $\\nu$-process in supernovae. The onset of more efficient\nLi production (relative to iron) in the young disk coincides with the\nappearance of Li from novae and AGB stars. The major challenge facing the\nmodels is to reconcile the mild evolution of Li during the halo and old-disk\nphases with the more efficient production (relative to iron) at [Fe/H] > -0.5.\nWe speculate that cool-bottom processing (production) of Li in low-mass stars\nmay provide an important late-appearing source of Li, without attendant Fe\nproduction, that might explain the Li production in the young disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2000 12:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The Li\ndeficiency of two of these is a new discovery. Three of the four stars have\neffective temperatures Teff ~ 6300 K, in contrast to previously known\nLi-deficient halo stars which spanned the temperature range of the Spite\nPlateau. In this paper we propose that these, and previously known\nultra-Li-deficient halo stars, may have had their surface lithium abundances\nreduced by the same mechanism as produces halo field blue stragglers. Even\nthough these stars have yet to reveal themselves as blue stragglers, they might\nbe regarded as \"blue-stragglers-to-be.\" In our proposed scenario, the surface\nabundance of Li in these stars could be destroyed (a) during the normal\npre-main-sequence single star evolution of their low mass precursors, (b)\nduring the post-main-sequence evolution of a evolved mass donor, and/or (c) via\nmixing during a mass-transfer event or stellar merger. The warmest Li-deficient\nstars at the turnoff would be regarded as emerging \"canonical\" blue stragglers,\nwhereas cooler ones represent sub-turnoff-mass \"blue-stragglers-to-be.\" The\nlatter are presently hidden on the main sequence, Li depletion being possibly\nthe clearest signature of their past history and future significance.\nEventually, the main sequence turnoff will reach down to their mass, exposing\nthose Li-depleted stars as canonical blue stragglers when normal stars of that\nmass evolve away. Arguing against this unified view is the observation that the\nthree Li-depleted stars at Teff ~ 6300 K are all binaries, whereas very few of\nthe cooler systems show evidence for binarity; it is thus possible that two\nseparate mechanisms are responsible for the production of Li-deficient\nmain-sequence halo stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2000 12:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
