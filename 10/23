We find that the bulk QCD cannot have larger coupling beyond\nthe non-trivial ultraviolet (UV) fixed point, the existence of which is\nsupported by a recent lattice analysis. The coupling strength at the fixed\npoint is evaluated by using the one-loop renormalization group equation. It is\nthen found that, in a version with only the third family (as well as the gauge\nbosons) living in the D-dimensional bulk, the critical (dimensionless) coupling\nfor dynamical chiral symmetry breaking to occur is larger than the UV fixed\npoint of the bulk QCD coupling for D=6, while smaller for D=8. We further find\nthat the improved ladder SD equation in D dimensions has an approximate\nscale-invariance due to the running of the coupling and hence has an\nessential-singularity scaling of the ``conformal phase transition,'' similar to\nMiransky scaling in the four-dimensional ladder SD equation with a nonrunning\ncoupling. This essential-singularity scaling can resolve the fine-tuning even\nwhen the cutoff (``string scale'') is large. Such a theory has a large\nanomalous dimension \\gamma_m=D/2 - 1 and is expected to be free from the\nflavor-changing-neutral-current problem as in walking technicolor for D=4.\nFurthermore, the induced bulk Yukawa coupling becomes finite even at infinite\ncutoff limit (in the formal sense), similarly to the renormalizability of the\ngauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.

The concept of\nCoherent Internal States is used in the formulation of the semiclassical\napproximation from the full quantum mechanical expression. The classical\ntrajectories are defined only for certain spin state, that satusfy the\nconditions for being Coherent Internal State. The raalibility of Stern-Gerlach\nexperiments to measure spin projectons is assessed in this framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2000 09:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
