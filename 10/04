To demonstrate this theory, a\ndynamical systems model consisting of the concentrations of metabolites,\nenzymes, amino acyl tRNA synthetase, and tRNA-amino acid complex in a cell is\nintroduced and numerically studied. It is shown that the biochemical states of\ncells are differentiated by cell-cell interaction, and each differentiated type\ntakes to use different synthetase.

According\nto the theory, phenotypes of organisms are first differentiated into distinct\ntypes through the interaction and developmental dynamics, even though they have\nidentical genotypes, and later with the mutation in genotype, the genotype also\ndifferentiates into discrete types, while maintaining the `symbiotic'\nrelationship between the types.

Induction linacs can now be built which can operate with MHz\nrepetition rates. Solid-state technology has also made possible the development\nof fast kickers for precision control of high current beams. New insulator\ntechnology has been developed which will improve conventional induction linacs\nin addition to enabling a new class of high gradient induction linacs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2000 21:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nwill see that there exists a remarkable connection between these basic\napproaches which could give a hint how to overcome the inherent limitations.\nThe approximations made in the models are not identical and lead to different\nadvantages and disadvantages. We notice that the dieletric model is able to\nhandle screening in a selfconsistent manner, but is limited to first order in\nthe electron-ion interaction. The ballistic model calculates the electron-ion\ncollision exactly in each order of the interaction, but has to introduce a\ncut-off to incorporate screening effects. This means in the context of kinetic\ntheory that the electron-ion correlation has to be calculated either in random\nphase or in ladder approximation, or, in other words, the linearized\nLenard-Balescu or Boltzmann collision term has to be used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2000 10:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2000 16:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
