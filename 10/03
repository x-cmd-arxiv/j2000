We use optical (SDSS) colors to identify the stellar spectral\nsequence and show that stars of different spectral types can have similar\ninfrared colors, thus making the classification of stars based on only 2MASS\ndata very difficult. However, a broad separation into ``early'' and ``late''\nspectral types (relative to type K0) is possible with a reliability of about\n95% even with 2MASS colors alone.\n  The distributions of matched sources in color-magnitude and color-color\ndiagrams are compared to the predictions of a stellar population synthesis\ncode. We find that the models are in fair overall agreement with the data. The\nmost significant discrepancies are found for the number ratio of ``early'' to\n``late'' type stars (by about a factor of 2) and in the colors of M stars (up\nto 0.2 mag).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2000 22:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This date is widely\nrecognized as birthday of quantum theory. For Planck it meant the end of his\ncarefully planned and ambitious research project, in which he wanted to\nestablish the second law of thermodynamics as strictly deterministic law for\nsystems of matter and electromagnetic radiation in interaction. He knew he\ncould not succeed within classical mechanics, but had the somewhat strange hope\nthat the inclusion of Maxwell's electrodynamics would change the situation.\nLater he always disagreed with Einstein's light-quantum hypothesis, because it\nimplied a renunciation from Maxwell's theory, which in Germany gained full\nrecognition and acceptance as late as the 1890's, mainly through the\ntheoretical and experimental work of Heinrich Hertz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2000 16:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We begin with a discussion of the conditional dynamics of simple\nsystems. The resulting models are straightforward but suffice to illustrate\nbasic physical ideas behind quantum measurements and decoherence. To discuss\ndecoherence and environment-induced superselection einselection in a more\ngeneral setting, we sketch perturbative as well as exact derivations of several\nmaster equations valid for various systems. Using these equations we study\neinselection employing the general strategy of the predictability sieve.\nAssumptions that are usually made in the discussion of decoherence are\ncritically reexamined along with the ``standard lore'' to which they lead.\nRestoration of quantum-classical correspondence in systems that are classically\nchaotic is discussed. The dynamical second law -it is shown- can be traced to\nthe same phenomena that allow for the restoration of the correspondence\nprinciple in decohering chaotic systems (where it is otherwise lost on a very\nshort time-scale). Quantum error correction is discussed as an example of an\nanti-decoherence strategy. Implications of decoherence and einselection for the\ninterpretation of quantum theory are briefly pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2000 22:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
