This yields unprecedented coverage of the radio\nluminosity versus z plane for steep-spectrum sources, and hence the most\naccurate measurements of the steep-spectrum RLF yet made. We find that a simple\ndual-population model for the RLF fits the data well, requiring differential\ndensity evolution (with z) for the two populations. The low-luminosity\npopulation can be associated with radio galaxies with weak emission lines, and\nincludes sources with both FRI and FRII radio structures; its comoving space\ndensity $\\rho$ rises by about one dex between z~0 and z~1 but cannot yet be\nmeaningfully constrained at higher redshifts. The high-luminosity population\ncan be associated with FRII radio galaxies and quasars with strong emission\nlines; its $\\rho$ rises by nearly three dex between z~0 and z~2. These results\nmirror the situation seen in X-ray and optically-selected AGN. The integrated\nradio luminosity density of the combination of the two populations is\ncontrolled by the value of $\\rho$ at the low-luminosity end of the RLF of the\nhigh-luminosity population, a quantity which has been directly measured at z~1\nby the 7CRS. We argue that robust determination of this quantity at higher\nredshifts requires a new redshift survey based on a large (~1000 source) sample\nabout five times fainter than the 7CRS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2000 18:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

The phase diagram and the\ncrossover between different critical behaviors is explored. For large film\nthicknesses we find a first order interface localisation/delocalisation\ntransition and the phase diagram comprises two critical points, which are the\nfinite film width analogies of the prewetting critical point.

We also computed the point spectrum\nthrough continued fractions, and identified the eigenvalues with nonzero real\nparts.\n  In this Part II of our study, first we discuss the Lax pairs for both 2D and\n3D Euler equations. The existence of Lax pairs suggests that the hyperbolic\nfoliations of 2D and 3D Euler equations may be degenerate, i.e., there exist\nhomoclinic structures. Then we investigate the question on the degeneracy v.s.\nnondegeneracy of the hyperbolic foliations for Galerkin truncations of 2D Euler\nequation. In particular, for a Galerkin truncation, we have computed the\nexplicit representation of the hyperbolic foliation which is of the degenerate\ncase, i.e., figure-eight case. We also study the robustness of this degeneracy\nfor a so-called dashed-line model through higher order Melnikov functions. The\nfirst order and second order Melnikov functions are all identically zero, which\nindicates that the degeneracy is relatively robust. The study in this paper\nserves a clue in searching for homoclinic structures for 2D Euler equation. The\nrecent breakthrough result of mine on the existence of a Lax pair for 2D Euler\nequation, strongly supports the possible existence of homoclinic structures for\n2D Euler equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2000 17:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2000 17:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
