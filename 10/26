Turning to less well investigated\nterrain, we discuss the impact of quantum diffractive scattering on the\nstructure of the density of states in the normal region. We consider ballistic\nsystems weakly disordered by pointlike impurities as a test case and\ndemonstrate that diffractive processes akin to normal metal weak localization\nlead to the formation of a hard spectral gap -- a hallmark of SN systems with\nchaotic dynamics. Turning to the more difficult case of clean systems with\nchaotic boundary scattering, we argue that semiclassical approaches, based on\nclassifications in terms of classical trajectories, cannot explain the gap\nphenomenon. Employing an alternative formalism based on elements of\nquasiclassics and the ballistic $\\sigma$-model, we demonstrate that the inverse\nof the so-called Ehrenfest time is the relevant energy scale in this context.\nWe discuss some fundamental difficulties related to the formulation of low\nenergy theories of mesoscopic chaotic systems in general and how they prevent\nus from analysing the gap structure in a rigorous manner.

The anomaly is responsible for the non-vanishing\nmaximally helicity violating amplitudes. The supersymmetric completion of the\nN=2 string spectrum is formulated by extending the previous cohomological\nanalysis with an external spin factor; the target space-time spin-statistics of\nthese individual fields in a selfdual background are compatible with previous\ncohomological analysis as fields of arbitrary spin may be bosonized into one\nanother. We further analyze duality relations between the open and closed\nstring amplitudes and demonstrate this in the supersymmetric extension of the\ntarget space-time theory through the insertion of zero-momentum operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2000 17:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2000 21:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
