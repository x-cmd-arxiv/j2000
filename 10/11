The mechanism does not rely on BPS properties of the brane and can\nbe realized in any theory where charged particles are confined to the\nworld-volume. The localized matter fluctuations induce a gauge kinetic term on\nthe brane. At short distances the resulting propagator for the gauge field is\n{\\it identical} to the four-dimensional propagator. The gauge theory on the\nbrane is effectively four-dimensional at short distances; it becomes\nhigher-dimensional on very large (cosmic) scales. The brane-bulk system\nexhibits the phenomenon of ``infrared transparency''. As a result, only very\nlow frequency modes can escape into extra dimensions. In this framework the\nlarge wavelength cosmic radiation can dissipate in extra space at a rate that\nmay be observable, in principle.
