Composite radial distributions of different stellar populations\nshow strong gradients as a function of cluster-centric radius.

The gas and dust may both be part of a strongly warped\ndisk; however, if caused by differential precession, the warp will wind up on\nitself in a few 10^7 years. The decoupling with the stellar component suggests\nthat the gas has an external origin, but no obvious source is present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2000 23:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The constraint of unitary evolution for non-dissipative quantum\nsystems imposes kinematical bounds on the optimization of arbitrary\nobservables. We summarize our previous results on kinematical bounds and show\nthat these bounds are dynamically realizable for completely controllable\nsystems. Moreover, we establish improved bounds for certain partially\ncontrollable systems. Finally, the question of dynamical realizability of the\nbounds for arbitary partially controllable systems is shown to depend on the\naccessible sets of the associated control system on the unitary group U(N) and\nthe results of a few control computations are discussed briefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2000 02:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-05"}
