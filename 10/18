There is\nample evidence that many disk galaxies have relatively shaprt truncations in\ntheir disks. These often are symmetric and independent of the wavelength band\nof the observations. The ratio of the truncation radius R_{max} to the disk\nscalelength h appears often less then 4.5, as expected on a simple model for\nthe disk collapse. Current samples of galaxies observed may however not be\nrepresentative and heavily biased towards disks with the largest scalelengths.\nMany spiral galaxies also have HI warps and these generally start at the\ntruncation radius of the stellar disk. The HI surface density suddenly becomes\nmuch flatter with radius. In some galaxies the start of the warp and the\nposition of the disk truncation radius is accompanied by a drop in the rotation\nvelocity. In the regiosn beyond the dis truncation in the HI layer some star\nformation does occur, but the heavy element abundance and the dust content are\nvery low. All evidence is consistent with the notion that the outer gas parts\nof the disks constitute recently accreted material, at least accreted after\nformation of what is now the stellar thin disk.

The scheme produces one intracavity\nphoton by means of an adiabatic passage technique based on a counter-intuitive\ninteraction sequence between pump laser and cavity field. This photon leaves\nthe cavity through the less-reflecting mirror. The emission rate shows a\ncharacteristic dependence on the cavity and pump detuning, and the observed\nspectra have a sub-natural linewidth. The results are in excellent agreement\nwith numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2000 08:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2002 13:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
