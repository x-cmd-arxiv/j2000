This activity peaked on August 27, 1998 when a giant\nperiodic gamma-ray flare resembling the famous March 5, 1979 event from SGR\n0526-66 was recorded. Two days later (August 29), a strong, bright burst was\ndetected with RXTE and BATSE. This event reveals several similarities to the\ngiant flares of August 27 and March 5, and shows a number of unique features\nnot previously seen in SGR bursts. Unlike typically short SGR bursts, this\nevent features a 3.5 s burst peak that was preceded by an extended (~ 1 s)\ncomplex precursor, and followed by a long (~ 1000 s) periodic tail modulated at\nthe 5.16 s stellar rotation period. Spectral analysis shows a striking\ndistinction between the spectral behavior of the precursor, burst peak and\nextended tail. While the spectrum during the peak is uniform, a significant\nspectral evolution is detected in both the precursor and tail emissions.\nTemporal behavior shows a sharp rise (~ 9.8 ms) at the event onset and a rapid\ncutoff (~ 17 ms) at the end of the burst peak. The tail pulsations show a\nsimple pulse profile consisting of one 5.16 s peak that did not evolve with\ntime. The spectral and temporal signatures of this event imply that the\nprecursor, main peak, and extended tail are produced by different physical\nmechanisms. We discuss these features and their implications in the context of\nthe magnetar model. The energetics of the August 29 event, and its close\nproximity to the August 27 flare, suggest that it is an `aftershock' of the\npreceding giant flare. \"P.S.

The spectral signature of vibrationally-\nexcited molecular hydrogen (VEMH) has been seen in every galaxy searched so far\nin a cluster cooling flow with an optical emission line nebula. We have\ndiscovered that the VEMH gas extends several kpc from the centers of A2597 and\nPKS0745, while the vibrationally-excited molecular hydrogen in NGC1275 appears\nto be mostly confined to its nucleus, with some extended emission <1 kpc from\nthe center.

UV heating by young stars provides the most satisfactory\nexplanation for the H2 emission in A2597 and PKS0745; X-ray irradiation is\nenergetically unlikely and strong shocks (v>40 km/s) are ruled out by the high\nH2/H-alpha ratios.

While it is\npossible in general to design interaction-free measurement schemes that do\npreserve that state, the requirement of quantum coherence preservation rapidly\nleads to a very low efficiency.
