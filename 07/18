During one type of bursts, called the irregular bursts,\nit was found that the source makes rapid transitions between two intensity\nstates. We have analyzed the RXTE PCA data obtained on 1997 June 18 (when the\nsource was making rapid state transitions) and compared the results with two\nsets of data each pertaining to the low hard-state and high-soft states. We\nfind that the power density spectrum (PDS) during the burst shows remarkable\nsimilarity to that seen during the high-soft state of the source. The PDS\nduring the quiescence, on the other hand, is quite flat and is very similar to\nthe PDS commonly seen during the canonical low-hard state of black hole X-ray\nbinaries.

The computation is performed for the polytropic\nindex n(=0.5, 0.66667, 0.8, 1, 1.25), and compactness of neutron stars\nM/R(=0.03 - 0.3). Results of this paper are as follows. (i) The sequences of\nthe irrotational binary are always terminated at an innermost orbit where a\ncusp (inner Lagrange point)appears at the inner edges of the stellar surface.\nThe binaries with cusps are found to be dynamically unstable for n=0.5 and\nstable for n > 0.8 irrespective of M/R < 0.2. For n=0.66667, the stability\nchanges depending on M/R. (ii) The gravitational wave frequency at the\ninnermost orbit turns out to be between 800 and 1500 Hz for realistic\ncompactness 0.14 < M/R < 0.2. (iii) The ISCO for n=0.5 appears to be determined\nby a hydrodynamic instability for M/R < 0.2. We derive fitting formulae for the\nrelation between the orbital angular velocity at the ISCO and the compactness\nto clarify it. (iv) The maximum density of neutron stars in binary systems\nslightly decreases with decreasing the orbital separation and hence they are\nstable against individual radial collapse during the inspiral. (v) q =\nJ_tot/M_ADM^2 at the innermost orbits is always less than unity for M/R > 0.13\nirrespective of n, which indicates that the realistic binary neutron stars\nsatisfy a necessary condition (q<1) for formation of a black hole before the\nmerger. (vi) The specific angular momentum of any mass element in irrotational\nbinary neutron stars at the innermost orbit appears to be too small to form a\ndisk around black holes formed after the merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2000 14:16:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2000 13:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2000 13:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Let F\nbe a unital C*-algebra, and let S_0 be a proper subset of its states within\nwhich one wants to keep the analysis (e.g. F is the group algebra of a discrete\ngroup G, and S_0 is the set of states continuous w.r.t. some nondiscrete\ntopology of G). Then a host algebra is a C*-algebra L for which we have\nembeddings of F and L into a larger C*-algebra E, such that the states on L\nextend uniquely to F, and this extension defines a norm continuous affine\nbijection between S_0 and the whole state space of L. The main examples (but\nnot the only ones) are group and covariance algebras. Here we study existence\nquestions of a host algebra for a given pair (F,S_0), we show that if a host\nalgebra exists, we can do integral decompositions of states in S_0 in terms of\nother states in S_0, and we show that if one does induction of representations\nvia host algebras one stays within the class of representations with the right\ncontinuity properties w.r.t. S_0. Moreover, if S_0 is a folium, then up to a\ncentral algebra one can always construct a host algebra, but this central\nalgebra can be an obstruction to the existence of a host algebra. These results\nshould be interesting to anyone who wants to construct group algebras for\ngeneral topological groups, and they are also useful for quantum physics due to\nsome selection criteria for physically acceptable states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2000 06:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The basic philosophy behind the\nDSC algorithm for the approximation of functions and their derivatives is\nstudied. Approximations to the delta distribution are constructed as either\nbandlimited reproducing kernels or approximate reproducing kernels. A\nsystematic procedure is proposed to handle a number of boundary conditions\nwhich occur in practical applications. The unified features of the DSC\nalgorithm for solving differential equations are explored from the point of\nview of the method of weighted residuals. It is demonstrated that different\nmethods of implementation for the present algorithm, such as global, local,\nGalerkin, collocation, and finite difference, can be deduced from a single\nstarting point. Both the computational bandwidth and the accuracy of the DSC\nalgorithm are shown to be controllable. Three example problems are employed to\nillustrate the usefulness, test the accuracy and explore the limitation of the\nDSC algorithm. A Galerkin-induced collocation approach is used for a waveguide\nanalysis in both regular and irregular domains and for electrostatic field\nestimation via potential functions. Electromagnetic wave propagation in three\nspatial dimensions is integrated by using a generalized finite difference\napproach, which becomes a global-finite difference scheme at certain limit of\nDSC parameters. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is a\npromising approach for solving problems in electromagnetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2000 11:39:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
