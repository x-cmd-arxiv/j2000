The $\\Upsilon$\nmass is evaluated to two loops, and including leading higher order\n[$O(\\alpha_s^5\\log\\alpha_s)$] and $m_c^2/m_b^2$ corrections. This allows us to\npresent updated values for the pole mass and $\\bar{MS}$ mass of the $b$ quark:\n$m_b=5022\\pm58$ MeV, for the pole mass, and $\\bar{m}_b(\\bar{m}_b)=4286\\pm36$\nMeV for the $\\bar{MS}$ one. The value for the \\msbar mass is accurate including\nand $O(\\alpha_s^3)$ corrections and leading orders in the ratio $m_c^2/m_b^2$.\nWe then consider the wave function for the ground state of $\\bar{b}b$, which is\ncalculated to two loops in the nonrelativistic approximation. Taking into\naccount the evaluation of the matching coefficients by Beneke and Signer one\ncan calculate, in principle, the width for the decay $\\Upsilon\\to e^+e^-$ to\norder $\\alpha_s^5$. Unfortunately, given the size of the corrections it is\nimpossible to produce reliable numbers. The situation is slightly better for\nthe ground state of toponium, where a decay width into $e^+e^-$ of 11 -- 14 keV\nis predicted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2000 10:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
