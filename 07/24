Antisymmetric boundaries, where\none surface attracts the A component with the same strength than the opposite\nsurface attracts the B component, are applied. The phase transition does not\noccur close to the bulk critical temperature but in the vicinity of the wetting\ntransition. For very thin films or weak surface fields one finds a single\ncritical point at $\\phi_c=1/2$. For thicker films or stronger surface fields\nthe phase diagram exhibits two critical points and two concomitant coexistence\nregions. Only below a triple point there is a single two phase coexistence\nregion. When we increase the film thickness the two coexistence regions become\nthe prewetting lines of the semi-infinite system, while the triple temperature\nconverges towards the wetting transition temperature from above. The behavior\nclose to the tricritical point, which separates phase diagrams with one and two\ncritical points, is studied in the framework of a Ginzburg-Landau ansatz.\nTwo-dimensional profiles of the interface between the laterally coexisting\nphases are calculated, and the interfacial and line tensions analyzed. The\neffect of fluctuations and corrections to the self-consistent field theory are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2000 09:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
