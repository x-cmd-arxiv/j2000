The mean number of living flares is\nconstrained to be in the range between 5 and 100, while their rates are found\nto be of order 1--100 per yr.

Along this work, we have discovered\nTLs between the 7-40 keV hard and 2-7 keV soft photons from 4U1728-34 with\namplitudes similar to those seen in 4U1705-44 (i.e. 2 ms at 5 Hz). We show that\nthe TLs are only seen in the low states of those sources, but that within the\nso-called ``island'' spectral state, some sources display TLs whereas some do\nnot. On the other hand, we have found that TLs are detected when the associated\nPower Density Spectrum (PDS) shows excess power at high frequencies (above 1\nHz).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2000 14:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Using the Einstein-Hilbert action principle, the physical\nscale factor R(t) =|\\hat{R}| is obtained as equal to (R_0^{2} + t^{2})^{1/2}\nwith R_0 representing the finite radius of the universe at t=0. The resulting\nphysical picture is roughly a theoretical justification of the old Ozer-Taha\nmodel. The new model is devoid of all cosmological problems. In particular, it\nconfirms the bounds on H_p, the present value of the Hubble parameter: 0.85 <\nH_p t_p < 1.91 and faces no age problem. We argue that the total energy density\nconsists of parts corresponding to relativistic/non-relativistic matter, a\npositive vacuum energy and a form of matter with equation of state p_K = -(1/3)\nrho_K (textures or generally K-matter), and the following predictions are made\nfor the present nonrelativistic era: Omega_{M,n.rel.} \\approx 2/3,\nOmega_{V,n.rel.} \\approx 1/3, Omega_ <<1, Omega_K \\approx 1, where a parameter\ncorresponding to K-matter is taken to be unity.

We arrive at\nthe present model by a radically new route, which extends the idea of a\nsignature change in the metric, a widely discussed speculation in the current\nliterature. An alternative approach uses some dimensional considerations in\nline with quantum cosmology and gives an almost identical model. Both\nderivations involve some fundamental issues in general theory of relativity.\nThe model has a coasting evolution (i.e., a \\propto t). It claims the absence\nof all the aforementioned puzzles in the standard model and has very good\npredictions.

A study of holomorphic\ncurves in the background of a Kaluza-Klein monopole and the associated\nreduction to type IIA supergravity sheds light on both issues. Many seemingly\nsingular D2/D6 intersections are shown to lift to smooth configurations of\nM2-branes in 11-dimensions, and a mechanism is found for certain $Z_2$\nconfinement effects in type II string theories that eliminates any need for\nhalf-branes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2000 01:08:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2000 13:03:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
