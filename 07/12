Using 1057 redshifts, we use the\ninfall pattern in redshift space to determine the mass profile of A576 to a\nradius of ~4 Mpc/h. This mass estimation technique makes no assumptions about\nthe equilibrium state of the cluster. Within 1 Mpc/h, the mass profile we\nderive exceeds that determined from X-ray observations by a factor of 2.5. At\n\\~2.5 Mpc/h, however, the mass profile agrees with virial mass estimates. Our\nmass profile is consistent with a NFW or Hernquist profile, but it is\ninconsistent with an isothermal sphere. R-band images of a $3^\\circ x 3^\\circ$\nregion centered on the cluster allow an independent determination of the\ncluster light profile. We calculate the integrated mass-to-light ratio as a\nfunction of cluster radius; it decreases smoothly from the core to ~4 Mpc/h.\nThe differential dM/dL_R profile decreases more steeply; we find M/L_R ~100 h\nat ~4 Mpc/h, in good agreement with the mass-to-light ratios of individual\ngalaxies. This value implies $\\Omega_m \\lesssim 0.4$ at 95% confidence. For a\nHernquist model, the best-fit mass profiles differ from the observed surface\nnumber density of galaxies; the galaxies have a larger scale radius than the\nmass. This result is consistent with the centrally peaked $M/L_R$ profile.\nSimilarly, the scale radius of the light profile is larger than that of the\nmass profile. We discuss some potential systematic effects; none can easily\nreconcile our results with a constant mass-to-light ratio.

Magnetic fields have been\nproposed to be principally responsible for the coexistence of these opposed\nmechanisms of accretion and outflowing. According to different models, the\nmagnetic fields are either twisted or stretched by the accretion disc, allowing\nthe formation of polar channels through which part of the accreting matter can\nescape. The high degree of coupling between the physical parameters describing\nthe young stellar object (e.g. circular velocity of the disc and the central\nobject, viscosity, strength and freezing of magnetic fields, etc.) makes\ndetailed understanding of the interaction between accretion discs and outflows\nvery difficult. The models presented here provide only a partial answer to this\ndifficult problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2000 10:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In general,\nit appears that holes tend to induce one-dimensional-like spin arrangements to\nimprove their mobility. Using ladders it is also shown that the very small\nJ/t$\\sim$0.1 regime of the standard t-J model may be more realistic than\nanticipated in previous investigations, since such regime shares several\nproperties with those found in the extended model at realistic couplings.\nAnother goal of the present article is to provide additional information on the\nrecently discussed tendencies to stripe formation and spin incommensurability\nreported for the extended t-J model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2000 21:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This is essentially equivalent to a perfect Eddington Slow\nClock Transfer protocol and thus, not an improvement over classical techniques.\nWe will discuss this and suggest ways in which QCS may still be used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2000 17:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
