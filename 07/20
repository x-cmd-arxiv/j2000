In such central region, is the mechanism of the star formation\ndistinct from that in disks of spiral galaxies? To reveal this, we estimate the\nstar formation efficiency (SFE) in this central 1-kpc star-forming region of\nsome early-type spiral galaxies, taking account of the condition for this 1-kpc\nregion to be self-gravitating. Using two indicators of present star formation\nrate (H$\\alpha$ and infrared luminosity), we estimate the SFE to be a few\npercents. This is equivalent to the observational SFE in the disks of late-type\nspiral (Sb--) galaxies. This coincidence may support the universality of the\nmean SFE of spiral galaxies reported in the recent studies. That is, we find no\nevidence of distinct mechanism of the star formation in the central 1-kpc\nregion of early-type galaxies. Also, we examine the structure of the central\nstar-forming region, and discuss a method for estimating the mass of\nstar-forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2000 11:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Although such theories are free of ultraviolet divergences, they\nstill violate unitarity while in a usual field theory such a violation occurs\nwhen the theory is nonrenormalizable. The compactness of space-like coordinates\nimplies discreteness of the time variable which leads to appearance of\nunphysical modes and violation of unitarity even in the absence of a\nstar-product in the interaction terms. Thus, this conclusion holds also for\nother quantum field theories with discrete time.
