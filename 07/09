These methods allow for both geometries of the process,\nnamely the transmission and the reflection, to be treated on an equal basis.\nOne approach to introduction of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian structures for the\n4WM systems is explored, and the obstacles in successful implementation of that\nprograme are identified. In case of real coupling these obstacles are\nremovable, and full Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of the initial\nsystem are possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jul 2000 20:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that the problem may be formulated in a flat\nspace of five dimensions, with five corresponding gauge fields in the framework\nof the classical version of a fully gauge covariant form of the Stueckelberg-\nFeynman-Schwinger covariant mechanics (the zero mode fields of the 0,1,2,3\ncomponents correspond to the Maxwell fields). Without additional constraints,\nthe particles and fields are not confined to their mass shells. We show that in\nthe mass-shell limit, the generalized Lorentz force obtained by means of the\nretarded Green's functions for the five-dimensional field equations provides\nthe classical Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac radiation reaction terms (with renormalized\nmass and charge). We also obtain general coupled equations for the orbit and\nthe off-shell dynamical mass during the evolution. The theory does not admit\nradiation if the particle remains identically on-shell.
