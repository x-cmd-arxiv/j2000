We examine the relative contribution of galaxies and\nICM to baryons in clusters through the gas-to-stellar mass ratio and find that\nthe typical stellar contribution to the baryonic mass is between 5 and 20%.\nThis ratio is found to be roughly independent of temperature. Therefore, we do\nnot confirm the trend of increasing gas-to-stellar mass ratio with increasing\ntemperature as previously claimed. We also determine distribution of the baryon\nfraction with the density contrast. Virial masses are estimated from two\ndifferent mass estimators: one based on the isothermal hydrostatic equation\n(IHE), the other based on scaling law models (SLM). Comparing the two methods,\nwe find that SLM lead to less dispersed baryon fractions over all density\ncontrasts and that the derived mean absolute valuesare significantly lower than\nIHE mean values. We show that this is not due to the uncertainties on the outer\nslope $\\beta$ of the gas density profile but is rather indicating that IHE\nmasses are less reliable. Examining the shape of the baryon fraction profiles\nwe find that cluster baryon fractions estimated from SLM follow a scaling law.\nMoreover, we do not find any strong evidence of increasing baryon (gas)\nfraction with temperature, neither do we find the slope $\\beta$ to increase\nwith temperature. The absence of clear trends between $f_{b}$ and\n$M_{gas}/M_{*}$ with temperature is consistent with the similarity of baryon\nfraction profiles and suggests that non-gravitational processes such as galaxy\nfeedback, do not play a dominant r\\^ole in heating the intra-cluster gas on the\nvirial scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2000 16:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2000 10:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We consider the complete evolution of two zero-metallicity stars of\n250 and 300 solar masses. Explosive oxygen and silicon burning cause the 130\nsolar mass helium core to explode, but explosive burning is unable to drive an\nexplosion in the 300 solar mass star and it collapses to a black hole. For this\nstar, the calculated angular momentum in the presupernova model is sufficient\nto delay black hole formation and the star initially forms a 50 solar mass,\n1000km core within which neutrinos are trapped.

Motivated\nby this, I construct here idealized spectral models of an Advection-Dominated\nAccretion Flow (ADAF) around a WD, for application to quiescent Dwarf Novae\n(DN). The Bremsstrahlung cooling of the gas in the ADAF, with temperatures\nranging from a few keV to a few tens of keV, can account for the X-ray emission\nproperties of quiescent DN. If the energy advected by the flow is thermalized\nin the WD atmosphere, the resulting emission from the entire stellar surface\n(blackbody of temperature T_eff ~ 5 eV) outshines the X-ray luminosity\nsubstantially. This extreme-UV component provides a flux in the 0.055-0.28 keV\nband which is sufficient to power the strong HeII lambda4686 emission lines of\nquiescent DN by photoionization of the disk material. Reprocessing of the ADAF\nX-ray emission by a cold outer thin disk could also lead to an observable iron\nKalpha fluorescence emission line, which can be used to probe the geometry of\nthe accretion flow. Existing observational data indicate that the presence of\nADAFs in quiescent DN is not ubiquitous, while future observations, in\nparticular with the X-ray satellites Chandra and XMM-Newton, have the potential\nto detect signatures of the hot flow in promising candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2000 15:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The temperature dependence of the scattering at the\ncharge and orbital wavevectors, and of the lattice constants, was characterized\nthroughout the ordered phase of each sample. It was found that the charge and\norbital order wavevectors are commensurate with the lattice, in striking\ncontrast to the results of earlier electron diffraction studies of samples with\n$x$=0.5. High momentum-transfer resolution studies of the x=0.4 and 0.5 samples\nfurther revealed that while long-range charge order is present, long-range\norbital order is never established. Above the charge/orbital ordering\ntemperature T$_o$, the charge order fluctuations are more highly correlated\nthan the orbital fluctuations. This suggests that charge order drives orbital\norder in these samples. In addition, a longitudinal modulation of the lattice\nwith the same periodicity as the charge and orbital ordering was discovered in\nthe x=0.4 and 0.5 samples. For x=0.25, only long-range orbital order was\nobserved with no indication of charge ordering, nor of an additional lattice\nmodulation.
