In\nthese systems in a quiescent state the accretion onto a white dwarf from the\nstrong enough wind of a companion star is suppressed by the magnetic field, and\nthe hot component luminosity is low. Since the gas stored in the envelope\neventually settles to the corotation radius the star-propeller reveals itself\nby long-time outbursts, short-time brightness dips, strong amplitude\nflickering, ejection of a powerful wind and jets.

They make it possible to understand the\nproduction, via secondary reactions, of the long-lived superheavy element with\nZ = 112 and of the abnormally low energy and very enhanced alpha-particle\ngroups seen in various actinide sources. They might also explain some puzzling\nphenomena seen in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2000 14:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2000 09:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-04-13"}

In such a computer, the energy gap between the ground state and first\nexcited state must be sufficiently large to prevent disruptive excitations.\nHere, an estimate is provided of this gap as a function of computer size. We\nthen address the problem of detecting the output of a ground state quantum\ncomputer. It is shown that the exponential detection difficulties that appear\nto be present at first can be overcome in a straightforward manner by small\ndesign changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2000 09:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
