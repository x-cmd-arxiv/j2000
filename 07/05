The apparent high energy of\nthe spin restricted state is attributed to an overestimate of on-site Coulomb\nrepulsion which is corrected in the unrestricted spin calculations. The\nstabilization of the total energy with spin polarization arises primarily from\nthe stabilization of the x2-y2 band, such that the character of the eigenstates\nat the top of the valence band in the antiferromagnetic state becomes a strong\nmixture of Cu x2-y2/O p(sigma) and Cu z2/O' p(z). Since the Hohenberg-Kohn\ntheorem requires the spin restricted and spin unrestricted calculations give\nexactly the same ground state energy and total density for the exact\nfunctionals, this large disparity in energy reflects the inadequacy of current\nfunctionals for describing the cuprates. This calls into question the use of\nband structures based on current restricted spin density functionals (including\nLDA) as a basis for single band theories of superconductivity in these\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2000 01:40:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jan 2001 05:33:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

We first consider the mapping\nmade by the characteristics of the hyperbolic equation (Poincar\\'e's equation)\nsatisfied by inviscid solutions. Characteristics are straight lines in a\nmeridional section of the shell, and the mapping shows that, generically, these\nlines converge towards a periodic orbit which acts like an attractor.\n  We then examine the relation between this characteristic path and\neigensolutions of the inviscid problem and show that in a purely\ntwo-dimensional problem, convergence towards an attractor means that the\nassociated velocity field is not square-integrable. We give arguments which\ngeneralize this result to three dimensions. We then consider the viscous\nproblem and show how viscosity transforms singularities into internal shear\nlayers which in general betray an attractor expected at the eigenfrequency of\nthe mode. We find that there are nested layers, the thinnest and most internal\nlayer scaling with $E^{1/3}$-scale, $E$ being the Ekman number. Using an\ninertial wave packet traveling around an attractor, we give a lower bound on\nthe thickness of shear layers and show how eigenfrequencies can be computed in\nprinciple.
