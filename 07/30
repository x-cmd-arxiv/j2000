The\ncontinuum source has a size of about 1.5''. The H_2 emission is resolved\nshowing a rotating ring/disk of ~1.2'' diameter. An analysis of the nuclear\nstellar light using population synthesis models in conjunction with NIR\nspectral synthesis models suggests following star formation history: Two\nstarbursts with decay times of 3 Myr occurred 3 - 5 Myr and 15 - ~50 Myr ago.\nContinuous star formation over at least 1Gyr can also explain the observed\nparameter. However, the mass relocation and consumption involved as well as the\ndifferent spatial distribution of the lines associated with the star formation\nstrongly favor the 'two starburst' scenario. In that scenario, up to 35% of the\ntotal observed Br_gamma flux could still be due to the AGN. In contrast to\nother starburst galaxies (e.g. M82, NGC 7552), the younger starburst in NGC6764\nis very likely located closer to the nucleus and surrounded by the older\nstarburst. One possible explanation can be that the stellar bar still\ntransports gas down to radii close to the nucleus. This suggests that the\nmassive star formation activity is directly competing with the AGN for the\nfuel. The 44 ksec. HRI ROSAT data show the presence of a X-ray source (probably\nan AGN) which varies by more than a factor of 2 over a time scale of 7 days.\nThis implies the presence of a compact source with a discrete or at most 1000\nAU source size.
