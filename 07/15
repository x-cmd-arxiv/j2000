The\nmacroworld violation is illustrated using an example involving connected\nvessels of water. We show that whether the violation of inequalities occurs in\nthe microworld or in the macroworld, it is the identification of nonidentical\nevents that plays a crucial role. Specifically, we prove that if nonidentical\nevents are consistently differentiated, Bell-type Pitowsky inequalities are no\nlonger violated, even for Bohm's example of two entangled spin 1/2 quantum\nparticles. We show how Bell inequalities can be violated in cognition,\nspecifically in the relationship between abstract concepts and specific\ninstances of these concepts. This supports the hypothesis that genuine quantum\nstructure exists in the mind. We introduce a model where the amount of\nnonlocality and the degree of quantum uncertainty are parameterized, and\ndemonstrate that increasing nonlocality increases the degree of violation,\nwhile increasing quantum uncertainty decreases the degree of violation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2000 21:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}
