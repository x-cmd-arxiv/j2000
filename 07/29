The driver accelerator meets requirements\nimposed by low energy, high current, and a demand for stringent beam control at\nthe wiggler and during energy recovery. These constraints are driven by the\nneed for six-dimensional phase space management, the existence of deleterious\ncollective phenomena (space charge, wakefields, beam break-up, and coherent\nsynchrotron radiation), and interactions between the FEL and the accelerator\nRF. We will detail the system design, relate commissioning highlights, and\ndiscuss present performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2000 17:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2000 15:54:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2000 20:03:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2000 14:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

In this model, the\ncumulative Benioff strain (BS) increases as a power-law time-to-failure before\nthe final event. This power law reflects a kind of scale invariance with\nrespect to the distance to the critical point. A few years ago, on the basis of\na fit of the cumulative BS released prior to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake,\nSornette and Sammis [1995] proposed that this scale invariance could be\npartially broken into a discrete scale invariance (DSI). The observable\nconsequence of DSI takes the form of log-periodic oscillations decorating the\naccelerating power law. They found that the quality of the fit and the\npredicted time of the event are significantly improved by the introduction of\nlog-periodicity. Here, we present a battery of synthetic tests performed to\nquantify the statistical significance of this claim. We find that log-periodic\noscillations with frequency and regularity similar to those of the Loma Prieta\ncase are very likely to be generated by the interplay of the low pass filtering\nstep due to the construction of cumulative functions together with the\napproximate power law acceleration. Thus, the single Loma Prieta case alone\ncannot support the initial claim and additional cases and further study are\nneeded to increase the signal-to-noise ratio if any. The present study will be\na useful methodological benchmark for future testing of additional events when\nthe methodology and data to construct reliable Benioff strain function become\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2000 17:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
