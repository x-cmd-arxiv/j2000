We note that if the high accretion rates estimated in permanent\nsuperhump systems represent their mean secular values, then their mass transfer\nrates cannot be explained by gravitational radiation, therefore, either\nmagnetic braking should be extrapolated to systems below the period gap or they\nmust have mass transfer cycles. Alternatively, a new mechanism that removes\nangular momentum from CVs below the gap should be invoked.\n  We suggest applying the nova cycle scenarios offered for systems above the\nperiod gap to the short orbital period CVs. Permanent superhumps have been\nobserved in the two non-magnetic ex-novae with binary periods below the gap.\nTheir post-nova magnitudes are brighter than their pre-outburst values. In one\ncase (V1974 Cyg) it has been demonstrated that the pre-nova should have been a\nregular SU UMa system. Thus it is the first nova whose accretion disc was\nobserved to change its thermal stability. If the superhumps in this system\nindicate persistent high mass transfer rates rather than a temporary change\ninduced by irradiation from the hot post-nova white dwarf, it is the first\ndirect evidence for mass transfer cycles in CVs.

In most cases these colour variations manifest themselves via\nthe presence of blue cores, an effect of opposite sign to that expected from\nmetallicity gradients. Examining similarly-selected ellipticals in five rich\nclusters with 0.37<z<0.83 we find a significant lower dispersion in their\ninternal colours.

Galactic wakes, for\nexample, are an apparent result of the ICM/galaxy interactions, and they\nconstitute an important tool for deciphering the motion of the cluster\ngalaxies. In this paper we investigate whether Bondi-Hoyle accretion can create\ngalactic wakes by focusing the ICM behind moving galaxies. The solution of the\nequations that describe this physical problem provide us with observable\nquantities along the wake at any time of its lifetime. We also investigate\nwhich are the best environmental conditions for the detectability of such\nstructures in the X-ray images of clusters of galaxies. We find that\nsignificant Bondi-Hoyle wakes can only be formed in low temperature clusters,\nand that they are more pronounced behind slow-moving, relatively massive\ngalaxies. The scale length of these elongated structures is not very large: in\nthe most favourable conditions a Bondi-Hoyle wake in a cluster at the redshift\nof z=0.05 is 12 arcsec long. However, the wake's X-ray emission is noticeably\nstrong: the X-ray flux can reach ~30 times the flux of the surrounding medium.\nSuch features will be easily detectable in Chandra's and XMM-Newton's X-ray\nimages of nearby, relatively poor clusters of galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2000 12:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is\napplied to protein-ligand dissociation under external force, unfolding of\npolyglobular proteins under extension, movement along linear tracks of motor\nproteins against load, and enzyme catalysis by single fluctuating proteins. As\na generalization of the classic polymer theory, the dynamic equation is capable\nof characterizing a single macromolecule in aqueous solution, in probabilistic\nterms, (1) its thermodynamic equilibrium with fluctuations, (2) transient\nrelaxation kinetics, and most importantly and novel (3) nonequilibrium\nsteady-state with heat dissipation. A reversibility condition which guarantees\nan equilibrium solution and its thermodynamic stability is established, an\nH-theorem like inequality for irreversibility is obtained, and a rule for\nthermodynamic consistency in chemically pumped nonequilibrium steady-state is\ngiven.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jul 2000 20:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 May 2001 17:37:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2001 00:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The eclipse period was characterized\nby a low level of geomagnetic disturbance (Dst - variation from -10 to -20 nT),\nwhich alleviated significantly the problem of detecting the ionospheric\nresponse to the eclipse. Our analysis revealed a well-defined effect of a\ndecrease (depression) of the total electron content (TEC) for all GPS stations.\nThe delay between minimum TEC values with respect to the totality phase near\nthe eclipse path increased gradually from 4 min in Greenwich longitude (10:40\nUT, LT) to 8 min at the longitude 16 degrees (12:09 LT). The depth and duration\nof the TEC depression were found to be 0.2-0.3 TECU and 60 min, respectively.\nThe results obtained in this study are in good agreement with earlier\nmeasurements and theoretical estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2000 05:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
