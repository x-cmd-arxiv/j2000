On the\nobservational side the evidence includes tidal tails and extratidal extensions,\nkinematic effects, effects on the mass function, and influences on the\nstatistical properties of surviving objects. Even for isolated clusters, the\ntheoretical issues are not fully understood. The effects of a steady tide (i.e.\nfor a cluster in a circular orbit) include the imposition of a tidal boundary,\nand lowering of the escape energy. Less familiar, however, are the effects of\ninduced mass loss. Even the definition of an ``escaper'' is not\nstraightforward. When mass loss is driven by relaxation, as in N-body models,\nthe rate of loss of mass does not scale in a simple way with the relaxation\ntime. Reasons for this include the very long time scales on which stars escape\neven with energies above the escape threshold. For the realistic case of\nunsteady tides it is still unclear under what circumstances mass loss is\ndominated by relaxation or tidal heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2000 16:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It will be shown that, unlike in the Newtonian case,\nthe cosmological equations of the post-Newtonian approximation are much more in\nthe spirit of general relativity with regard to the nine Bianchi types and\nissues of singularities. The situations of vanishing rotation and vanishing\nshear are treated separately. The homogeneous Bianchi I model is considered as\nan example of a rotation-free cosmology with anisotropy. It is found in the\nNewtonian approximation that there are arbitrary functions that need to be\ngiven for all time if the initial value problem is to be well-posed, while in\nthe post-Newtonian case there is no such need. For the general case of a\nperfect fluid only the post-Newtonian theory can satisfactorily describe the\neffects of pressure. This is in accordance with findings in an earlier paper\nwhere the post-Newtonian approximation was applied to homogeneous cosmologies.\nFor a shear-free anisotropic homogeneous cosmology the Newtonian theory of\nHeckmann and Sch\\\"ucking is explored. Comparisons with its relativistic and\npost-Newtonian counterparts are made. In the Newtonian theory solutions exist\nto which there are no analogues in general relativity. The post-Newtonian\napproximation may provide a way out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jul 2000 15:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
