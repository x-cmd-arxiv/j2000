As we show, CDM indeed requires\nsome amount of tuning of the feedback efficiencies to obtain a Tully-Fisher\nrelation (TFR) as steep as observed. However, that same model is in excellent\nagreement with a wide variety of additional observations. Therefore, the modest\namount of feedback needed should not be regarded a fine-tuning problem.\nInstead, its requirement should be considered a generic prediction for CDM,\nwhich might be tested with future observations and with detailed modeling of\nfeedback processes.

The surface brightness\nprofiles of the underlying host galaxies in either iI,C BCD show an exponential\ndecay with a central surface brightness and scale length that are intermediate\nbetween typical iE/nE BCDs and dIs.

It has been considered at all\nconvective boundaries, including the He-flash convection zone in the intershell\nregion which forms during the thermal pulses. Both the structural and the\nchemical evolution are affected by the inclusion of overshoot. The main results\ninclude a very efficient third dredge-up which leads to the formation of carbon\nstars of low mass and luminosity. A C13 pocket which may serve as a neutron\nsource for the s-process can form after the third dredge-up has reached into\nthe C12 rich intershell. Overshoot applied to the pulse-driven convective zone\nduring the He-flash leads to a deeper penetration of the bottom of this\nconvective zone into the C/O core below the He-burning shell. This in turn\ncauses He4 to be less abundant in the intershell while C12 and O16 are more\nabundant compared to calculations without overshoot. We show that overshoot at\nthe He-flash convection zone as well as at the base of the envelope convection\nenhance the efficiency of the third dredge-up. Characteristic properties of the\nstructural and chemical evolution of AGB stars are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2000 14:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such\nbasic property breaks down when the source galaxies happen to be observed\nthrough two clusters at different redshifts, partially aligned along the line\nof sight. In this paper we address the study of double lenses and obtain five\nmain results. (i) First we generalize the procedure to extract the available\ninformation, contained in the observed shear field, from the case of a single\nlens to that of a double lens. (ii) Then we evaluate the possibility of\ndetecting the signature of double lensing given the known properties of the\ndistribution of clusters of galaxies. (iii) As a different astrophysical\napplication, we demonstrate how the method can be used to detect the presence\nof a dark cluster that might happen to be partially aligned with a bright\ncluster studied in terms of statistical lensing. (iv) In addition, we show that\nthe redshift distribution of the source galaxies, which in principle might also\ncontribute to break the curl-free character of the shear field, actually\nproduces systematic effects typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the\ndouble lensing effects we are focusing on. (v) Remarkably, a discussion of\nrelevant contributions to the noise of the shear measurement has brought up an\nintrinsic limitation of weak lensing analyses, since one specific contribution,\nassociated with the presence of a non-vanishing two-galaxy correlation\nfunction, turns out not to decrease with the density of source galaxies (and\nthus with the depth of the observations).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2000 15:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The framework proves\nsufficiently general to include also a coupling of the branes to (the bosonic\nsector of) a dynamical supergravity theory. We provide a manifestly\nLorentz-invariant and S-duality symmetric Lagrangian, involving the (n+1)-form\ngauge potential and its dual (D-n-3)-form gauge potential in a symmetric way.\nThe corresponding action depends on generalized Dirac-strings. The requirement\nof string-independence of the action leads to Dirac-Schwinger quantization\nconditions for the charges of branes and dual branes, but produces also\nadditional constraints on the possible interactions. It turns out that a system\nof interacting dyonic branes admits two quantum mechanically inequivalent\nformulations, involving inequivalent quantization conditions. Asymmetric\nformulations involving only a single vector potential are also given. For the\nspecial cases of dyonic branes in even dimensions known results are easily\nrecovered. As a relevant application of the method we write an effective action\nwhich implements the inflow anomaly cancellation mechanism for interacting\nheterotic strings and five-branes in D=10. A consistent realization of this\nmechanism requires, in fact, dynamical p-form potentials and a systematic\nintroduction of Dirac-strings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2000 18:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-03"}

In this way, reported and ``missing'' resonances become\ndistinguishable. For example, resonances from the full listing reported by the\nParticle Data Group are accommodated by Rarita-Schwinger (RS) type\nrepresentations (k/2,k/2)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] with k=1,3, and 5, the highest spin\nstates being J=3/2^-, 7/2^+, and 11/2^+, respectively.

The present paper treats the impact of inertons on the collective\nbehaviour of atoms in a solid. It is shown that inertons should contribute to\nthe effective potential of interaction of atoms in the crystal lattice. The\npossibility of separating this inerton contribution from the value of the atom\nvibration amplitude is analysed. The experiment which assumes the presence of\nthe hypothetical inerton field is performed. The expected changes in the\nstructure of the test specimens caused by this field are in fact convincingly\nfixed in micrographs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2000 04:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
