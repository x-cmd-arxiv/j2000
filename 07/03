First, by constructing in loop space a nonabelian\ngeneralization of the abelian dual transform (Hodge *), one finds that a\n``magnetic'' symmetry exists also in classical Yang-Mills theory dual to the\noriginal (``electric'') gauge symmetry. Secondly, from a result of 't Hooft's,\none obtains that for confined colour SU(3), the dual symmetry\n$\\widetilde{SU}(3)$ is spontaneously broken and can play the role of the\n``horizontal symmetry'' for generations. Thirdly, such an identification not\nonly offers an explanation why there should be three and apparently only three\ngenerations of fermions with the remarkable mass and mixing patterns seen in\nexperiment, but allows even a calculation of the relevant parameters giving\nvery sensible results. Other testible predictions follow ranging from rare\nhadron decays to cosmic ray air showers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2000 14:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2000 17:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}
