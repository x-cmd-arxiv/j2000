Recent studies suggest that the cold dark matter model\npredicts cores that are denser than those observed in galaxies, groups and\nclusters. One possible resolution of the discrepancy is that the dark matter\nhas strong interactions (SIDM), which leads to lower central densities. A\ngeneralized form of the Navarro, Frenk and White profile (Zhao profile) may be\nused to describe these halos. In this paper we examine gravitational lensing\nstatistics for this class of model. The optical depth to multiple imaging is a\nvery sensitive function of the profile parameters in the range of interest for\nSIDM halos around clusters of galaxies. Less concentrated profiles, which\nresult from larger self-interaction cross-sections, can produce many fewer\nlensed pairs. Lensing statistics provide a powerful test for SIDM. More\nrealistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to be done, however\nlarger self-interaction cross-sections may well be ruled out by the very\nexistence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster scales. The inclusion of centrally\ndominant cluster galaxies should boost the cross-section to multiple imaging.\nHowever our preliminary calculations suggest that the additional multiple\nimaging rate is small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging rate\nfor different halo profiles. In future statistical studies, it will be\nimportant to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles since the\noptical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most concentrated members\nof a cluster population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2000 17:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 May 2001 17:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In the model, the M_bh - sigma relation is significantly tighter than\nthe correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity or the correlation\nbetween bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion. There are two reasons for\nthis: i) the gas masses of bulge progenitors depend on the velocity dispersion\nbut not on the formation epoch of the bulge, whereas the stellar masses of the\nprogenitors depend on both; ii) mergers between galaxies move black holes along\nthe observed M_bh - sigma relation, even at late times when the galaxies are\ngas-poor and black holes grow mainly by merging of pre-existing black holes.

Combined ROSAT and ASCA imaging\nshow that the remnant is highly asymmetric, with its hard X-ray emission\npeaking at the western lobe. The spectrum of 3C 397 is heavily absorbed, and\ndominated by thermal emission with emission lines evident from Mg, Si, S, Ar\nand Fe. Single-component models fail to describe the spectrum, and at least two\ncomponents are required. We use a set of non-equilibrium ionization (NEI)\nmodels (Borkowski et al. in preparation).

This problem is extremely difficult, hence people restrict it\nto certain classes of Hopf algebras, e.g. to semisimple ones. Semisimple Hopf\nalgebras deserve to be considered as \"quantum\" analogue of finite groups, but\neven so, the problem remains extremely hard (even in low dimensions) and very\nlittle is known. A great boost to the theory of Hopf algebras was given by\nDrinfeld who invented the fundamental class of (quasi)triangular Hopf algebras\n(A,R). Thus, it is natural to first try to classify semisimple triangular Hopf\nalgebras (A,R) over k (i.e. R is unitary). The theory of such Hopf algebras is\nnow essentially closed by a sequence of works by P. Etingof and the author. The\nkey theorem in this theory states that A is obtained from a group algebra of a\nunique (up to isomorphism) finite group by twisting its usual comultiplication.\nThe proof of this theorem relies on Deligne's theorem on Tannakian categories\nin an essentail way.

Why is this interesting? Comparing this\nsituation to the introductory physics textbook example of diffraction of a\nlaser beam by a grating, the particle beam plays the role of the incoming wave\nand the standing light wave the role of the material grating, highlighting\nparticle - wave duality. Apart from representing such a beautiful example of\nparticle - wave duality, the diffracted particle beams are coherent. This\nallows the construction of matter interferometers and explains why the Kapitza\n- Dirac effect is one of the workhorses in the field of atom optics. Atom\noptics concerns the manipulation of atomic waves in ways analogous to the\nmanipulation of light waves with optical elements. The excitement and activity\nin this new field of physics stems for a part from the realisation that the\nshorter de Broglie wavelengths of matter waves allow ultimate sensitivities for\ndiffractive and interferometric experiments that in principle would far exceed\ntheir optical analogues. Not only is the Kapitza - Dirac effect an important\nenabling tool for this field of physics, but diffraction peaks have never been\nobserved for electrons, for which is was originally proposed in 1933. Why has\nthis not been observed? What is the relation between the interaction of laser\nlight with electrons and the interaction of laser light with atoms, or in other\nwords what is the relation between the ponderomotive potential and the\nlightshift potential? Would it be possible to build interferometers using the\nKapitza - Dirac effect for other particles?
