The spin\naxes are deduced from recent Chandra X-ray Observatory images that reveal jets\nand nebular structure having definite symmetry axes. The alignments indicate\nthese pulsars were born either in isolation or with negligible velocity\ncontributions from binary motions. We examine the effects of rotation and the\nconditions under which spin-kick alignment is produced for various models of\nneutron star kicks. If the kick is generated when the neutron star first forms\nby asymmetric mass ejection or/and neutrino emission, then the alignment\nrequires that the protoneutron star possesses an original spin with period\n$P_s$ much less than the kick timescale, thus spin-averaging the kick forces.\nThe kick timescale ranges from 100 ms to 10 s depending on whether the kick is\nhydrodynamically driven or neutrino-magnetic field driven. For hydrodynamical\nmodels, spin-kick alignment further requires the rotation period of an\nasymmetry pattern at the radius near shock breakout (>100 km) to be much less\nthan ~100 ms; this is difficult to satisfy unless rotation plays a dynamically\nimportant role in the core collapse and explosion ($P_s\\lo 1$ ms). Aligned kick\nand spin vectors are inherent to the slow process of asymmetric electromagnetic\nradiation from an off-centered magnetic dipole. We reassess the viability of\nthis effect, correcting a factor of 4 error in Harrison and Tademaru's\ncalculation that increases the size of the effect. To produce a kick velocity\nof order a few hundred km/s requires that the neutron star be born with an\ninitial spin close to 1 ms and that spindown due to r-mode driven gravitational\nradiation be inefficient compared to standard magnetic braking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2000 17:19:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2000 22:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The most important aspect of our approach is a\nself-consistent treatment, using the same formalism for calculating cross\nsections and particle production, based on an effective, QCD-inspired field\ntheory, where many of the inconsistencies of presently used models will be\navoided.\n  In addition, we provide a unified treatment of soft and hard scattering, such\nthat there is no fundamental cutoff parameter any more defining an artificial\nborder between soft and hard scattering.\n  Our approach cures some of the main deficiencies of two of the standard\nprocedures currently used: the Gribov-Regge theory and the eikonalized parton\nmodel. There, cross section calculations and particle production cannot be\ntreated in a consistent way using a common formalism. In particular, energy\nconservation is taken care of in case of particle production, but not\nconcerning cross section calculations. In addition, hard contributions depend\ncrucially on some cutoff, being divergent for the cutoff being zero. Finally,\nin case of several elementary scatterings, they are not treated on the same\nlevel: the first collision is always treated differently than the subsequent\nones. All these problems are solved in our new approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2000 23:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Periodic\nmodulations of the driving voltage at approximately twice the traveling\nfrequency are used. For a large enough modulation amplitude, standing waves\nthat consist of only zig or zag rolls are stabilized. The standing waves\nexhibit regular behavior in space and time. Therefore, modulation of the\ncontrol parameter represents a method of eliminating spatiotemporal chaos. As\nthe modulation frequency is varied away from twice the traveling frequency,\nstanding waves that are a superposition of zig and zag rolls, i.e. standing\nrectangles, are observed.

Two sets of intertwining and ladder operators are presented to\nalgebraically generate eigenstates with energies isomorphic to those of the\nordinary harmonic oscillator. Normalization conditions are examined to reject\nunphysical cases. Generic theory is specialized to one dimensional linear\noscillator and N dimensional radial oscillators in odd dimensions N=1,3,5..,\nwhere orthogonal basis or sets of staggered orthogonal bases can be identified.\nEven dimensions N=2,4,6.. are rejected as ill defined since they do not lead to\nproperly defined bases. The theory is augmented by a short Haskell program\nSpike, which directly implements the intertwining and ladder operators,\ngenerates the eigenfunctions, tests integrability of the solutions, verifies\northogonality conditions and tests consistency of theoretical claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2000 20:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
