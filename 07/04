The only noteworthy feature was the hint\nof a proximity effect during periastron passage, supported also in the optical.\nWe discuss the accuracy of our results, and also analyse archival ROSAT\nobservations. We investigate why we do not see a clear colliding winds\nsignature. A simple model shows that the wind attenuation to the expected\nposition of the shock apex is negligible throughout the orbit, which poses the\npuzzling question of why the expected 1/D variation (ie. a factor of 7.5) in\nthe intrinsic luminosity is not seen in the data. Two scenarios are proposed:\neither the colliding winds emission is unexpectedly weak such that intrinsic\nshocks in the winds dominate the emission, or, alternatively, that the emission\nobserved is colliding winds emission but in a more complex form than we would\nnaively expect. Complex hydrodynamical models are then analyzed. Despite\nstrongly phase-variable emission from the models, both were consistent with the\nobservations. We find that if the mass-loss rates of the stars are low then\nintrinsic wind shocks could dominate the emission. However, when we assume\nhigher mass-loss rates of the stars, we find that the observed emission could\nalso be consistent with a purely colliding winds origin.

The proof uses differential geometry to show that if d<2m and the\nembedding is smooth and isometric, we can construct a line from the center of\nD^m to the boundary that is geodesic in both D^m and in the embedding manifold\n{\\mathbb R}^d. Since such a line has length 1, the diameter of the embedding\nball must exceed 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2000 17:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-02"}
