This interaction may\ninvolve spin or orbital variables. There are cases where the conduction\nelectrons have conserved quantum numbers that do not appear in the coupling. An\nexample is where the Kondo effect involves orbital degrees of freedom, and the\ninteraction is independent of the real spins of the electrons, which are\nconserved and lead to the two-channel Kondo (2CK) problem. The low temperature\nbehavior is very different for the one- and two-channel cases, as in the first\ncase a Fermi liquid is formed while in the second one strong deviations appear\nand a non-Fermi liquid state is realized. Mesoscopic samples provide a unique\npossibility to study a few or even a single Kondo impurities. In this paper we\nfirst review how the original spin Kondo problem is affected by surface\nanisotropy and the fluctuations of the density of states in point contacts\n(PCs). We discuss the physics of a single magnetic impurity on the surface of a\nsample. The orbital 2CK effect due to dynamical defects is considered. The\nnature of these defects is not known but they are excellent candidates to\ndescribe the zero-bias anomalies with non-Fermi liquid character in PCs, and\nthe dephasing time and transport in short wires. There are two main concerns\nregarding this interpretation: First, the tunneling centers formed by heavy\nimpurities may produce a Kondo temperature that is too low, and secondly, the\nsplittings seen in the experiments are much smaller than expected from this\nmodel. It would be therefore extremely important to identify the microstructure\nof these two-level systems and find new realizations for them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2000 13:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2001 10:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Only for $n\\ge{7}$ does one discern the factorial\ngrowth and alternations of sign. Out all-order results are used to scrutinize\nthe performance of multiloop estimates, within the ``naive nonabelianization''\nprocedure, and the effective charges approach. The asymtotic behaviour of\nperturbative coefficients, in both large $N_f$ and large $N_c$ limits, is\nanalysed. A contour-improved resummation technique in the time-like region is\ndeveloped. Some subtleties of scheme-dependence are illustrated using results\nin the $\\bar{MS}$ and $V$-schemes. The all-order series under investigation are\nsummed up with the help of the Borel resummation method. The results obtained\nare relevant to the analysis of the theoretical uncertainties in the 4-loop\nextractions of the running and invariant $s$-quark masses from QCD sum rules,\nand in calculations of the Higgs boson decay width into a quark-antiquark pair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2000 12:43:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2000 15:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
