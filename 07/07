From\nmodelling the MECS radial profile in several energy bands, the optical depth to\ndust scattering at 1 keV was found to be 2.4+/-0.4. The non-dip and dip spectra\nof X1624-490 in the energy band 1-100 keV are well-described by emission\nconsisting of a point-like blackbody from the neutron star plus extended\nComptonized emission from an ADC. The blackbody temperature was 1.31+/-0.07 keV\nand the Comptonized emission had photon power law index 2.0+0.5/-0.7 and\ncut-off energy ~12 keV. Good fits to the dip spectra were obtained by allowing\nthe Comptonized emission to be progressively covered by an extended absorber\nwhile the blackbody was rapidly absorbed and a constant halo component\naccounted for dust scattering into the line-of-sight. From the dip ingress\ntime, a diameter of the extended Comptonized emission region of 5.3+/-0.8x10^10\ncm was derived, consistent with a hot, X-ray emitting corona extending to ~50%\nof the accretion disk radius. The source luminosity for a distance of 15 kpc is\n7.3x10^37 erg/s, an appreciable fraction of the Eddington limit making\nX1624-490 the most luminous dipping LMXB. The half-height of the blackbody\nemitting region on the neutron star of 6.8+/-1.8 km agrees well with the\nhalf-height of the radiatively supported inner accretion disk of 6.3+/-2.9 km.\nTogether with similar agreement recently obtained for 13 other LMXB in an ASCA\nsurvey (Church & Balucinska-Church 2000), this strongly supports the\nidentification of the neutron star as the origin of the blackbody emission in\nLMXB and suggests a mechanism in which the disk height is the main factor\ndetermining the level of blackbody emission. Finally, from RXTE ASM data, we\nderive an improved orbital period of 20.87+/-0.01 hr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2000 16:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The aim of the\nwork is twofold. Firstly, it attempts to contribute to clarify some confusing\ninformation about the comparison between both methods appearing in the related\nliterature. In doing so, several directions have been explored, including:\ntesting several modifications of the basic learning algorithms and varying the\nfeature space. Secondly, an improvement of both algorithms is proposed, in\norder to deal with large attribute sets. This modification, which basically\nconsists in using only the positive information appearing in the examples,\nallows to improve greatly the efficiency of the methods, with no loss in\naccuracy. The experiments have been performed on the largest sense-tagged\ncorpus available containing the most frequent and ambiguous English words.\nResults show that the Exemplar-based approach to WSD is generally superior to\nthe Bayesian approach, especially when a specific metric for dealing with\nsymbolic attributes is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2000 15:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

With\nthis technique, an administrator has to tune a set of rules for each topic.\nHowever, filters become obsolescent over time. The decrease of their\nperformances is due to diachronic polysemy of terms that involves a loss of\nprecision and to diachronic polymorphism of concepts that involves a loss of\nrecall.\n  To help the administrator to maintain his filters, we have developed a method\nwhich automatically detects filtering obsolescence. It consists in making a\nlearning-based control filter using a set of documents which have already been\ncategorised as relevant or not relevant by the rule-based filter. The idea is\nto supervise this filter by processing a differential comparison of its\noutcomes with those of the control one.\n  This method has many advantages. It is simple to implement since the training\nset used by the learning is supplied by the rule-based filter. Thus, both the\nmaking and the use of the control filter are fully automatic. With automatic\ndetection of obsolescence, learning-based filtering finds a rich application\nwhich offers interesting prospects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2000 15:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For each of\nthe two covariant differential calculi over $R^N_q$ based on the $R$-matrix\nformalism, we summarize our construction of a frame, the dual inner\nderivations, a metric and two torsion-free almost metric compatible covariant\nderivatives with a vanishing curvature. To obtain these results we have\ndeveloped a technique which fully exploits the quantum group covariance of\n$R^N_q$. We first find a frame in the larger algebra $\\Omega^*(R^N_q) \\cocross\n\\uqs$. Then we define homomorphisms from $R^N_q \\cocross U_q^{\\pm}{so(N)}$ to\n$R^N_q$ which we use to project this frame in $\\Omega^*(R^N_q)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2000 12:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
