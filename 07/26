Recent stellar evolution models indicate\nthat radiative burning of C13 between thermal pulses in low-mass AGB stars may\nindeed provide the needed neutrons. Some mixing between the proton-rich\nenvelope and the carbon-rich core may lead to the production of C13. However,\nthe responsible physical mechanism is not yet unambiguously identified. We\npresent stellar model calculations with overshoot and rotation. Overshoot, with\na time-dependent and exponentially decaying efficiency, leads to a partial\nmixture of protons and C12 during the third dredge-up. According to the\ndepth-dependent ratio of protons and C12, a small C13-pocket forms underneath a\nN14-rich layer. Overshoot does not allow for any mixing during the interpulse\nphase. Rotation introduces mixing driven by large angular velocity gradients\nwhich form at the envelope-core interface in AGB stars, in particular after a\nthermal pulse. This leads to partial mixing after a pulse, as in the case of\novershoot. However, rotation continues to mix the region of the C13-pocket with\na diffusion coefficient of log D ~ 2...3 [cm**2 / s]. This does not only spread\nthe C13-pocket, but also the more massive N14-rich layer, and finally leads to\nmixture of both layers. By the time when the temperature there has risen to\nabout 9*10E7K and neutron production sets in, the N14 abundance exceeds the C13\nabundance by a factor of 5...10. We analyze the role of N14 as a neutron poison\nby considering the recycling of neutrons via N14(n,p)C14 and\nC12(p,gamma)N13(beta+)C13 qualitatively. We find that as long as X(N14) <<\nX(C12), the s-process will still be possible to occur under radiative\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2000 12:58:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

More than $10^5$ stars are detected in total, down to a magnitude of V\n$\\sim 23.5$.\n  Due to the low galactic latitude of the studied fields, the scale length and\nmainly the scale height of the thick disk are not strongly constrained by the\nobservations. However a thin disk scale height of about\n  250$\\pm 60$ pc seems to be favored. The data are very sensitive to the star\nformation rate of the thin disk. A decreasing star formation rate (SFR) is\nnecessary to reproduce the distribution of the stars in the colour-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) as well as the luminosity functions. A constant or a strongly\nincreasing SFR as derived using Hipparcos data for the solar neighborhood\n(Bertelli et al 1999) are marginally in agreement with the luminosity functions\nbut they are at odds with the CMDs.
