I demonstrate that these statistics should not be used to determine the\ngoodness-of-fit with data values of 10 or less.

I\ndemonstrate that the modified chi-square-gamma statistic performs (nearly) like\nan ideal chi-square statistic for the determination of goodness-of-fit with\nlow-count data. On average, for correct (true) models, the mean value of\nmodified chi-square-gamma statistic is equal to the number of degrees of\nfreedom (nu) and its variance is 2*nu --- like the chi-square distribution for\nnu degrees of freedom. Probabilities for modified chi-square-gamma\ngoodness-of-fit values can be calculated with the incomplete gamma function.
