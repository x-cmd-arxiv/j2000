In the most discussed model of GRBs, namely\nthe ``fireball'' model, a highly relativistic shock forms and seems capable of\naccelerating the cosmic rays up to the EeV range. However, only the first Fermi\ncycle produces a large energy gain to particles coming from the external\nmedium. Thus, a complementary acceleration is proposed, downstream of the\nexternal shock, in the relativistic plasma of the GRBs, where crossings of\nrelativistic fronts are likely to occur. Both forward and backward fronts are\nnecessary for the internal Fermi acceleration to work and the physical process\nthat generates them is presented. We found that there exists a relevant\nphysical process similar to Brillouin backscattering that redistributes the\nincoming energy in the plasma shell. This redistribution occurs through the\ngeneration of sound waves that heat the plasma shell and also through the\ngeneration of both forward and backward relativistic Alfven fronts that\naccelerate cosmic rays by the Fermi process. We show that this ensemble of\nprocesses is able to account for the generation of UHE cosmic rays.\n  There are two opportunities for these combined processes, first during the\n``primary'' Gamma-Ray Burst where baryons are entrained by the relativistic\npair wind, second during the predeceleration and deceleration stages when the\nfireball interacts with the interstellar medium. However, because of the\nsynchrotron losses, only the second stage can produce the UHE cosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2000 16:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

An amplitude of harmonic\nproduction is given by the coherent sum of contributions from different\nintermediate ATI channels labeled by the number m of absorbed laser photons.\nThe range of m-values that gives substantial contribution is explored and found\nto be rather broad for high harmonic generation. The coherence effects are of\ncrucial importance being responsible for the characteristic pattern of harmonic\nintensities with a plateau domain followed by a cutoff region. Due to\nmultiphoton nature of the process, an efficient summation of m-contributions\ncan be carried out in the framework of the saddle point method. The saddle\npoints correspond to some complex-valued labels m=m_c associated with the\nintermediate effective ATI channels in the three-step harmonic generation\nprocess. The advantage of this approach stems from the fact that summation over\nlarge number of conventional ATI m-channels is replaced by summation over small\nnumber of effective m_c-channels.

We report that the quantum recurrences\nserve as a tool to connect phase space of the driven system with spectrum in\nquantum domain. With the help of quantum recurrences we investigate the\nquasi-energy spectrum of the system for a certain fixed modulation strength. In\naddition, we study transition of spectrum from discrete to continuum as a\nfunction of modulation strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2000 17:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
