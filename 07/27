The star formation efficiency (SFE),\nnecessary for forming a gravitationally bound stellar cluster, is determined.\n  Two sets of numerical N-body simulations are presented: As a first simplified\napproach we treat the residual gas as an external potential. The gas expulsion\nis approximated by reducing the gas mass to zero on a given timescale, which is\ntreated as a free parameter. In a second set of simulations we use smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics (SPH) to follow the dynamics of the outflowing residual\ngas self-consistently. We investigate cases where gas outflow is induced by an\noutwards propagating shock front and where the whole gas cloud is heated\nhomogeneously, leading to ejection.\n  If the stars are in virial equilibrium with the gaseous environment\ninitially, bound clusters only form in regions where the local SFE is larger\nthan 50% or where the gas expulsion timescale is long compared to the dynamical\ntimescale. A small initial velocity dispersion of the stars leads to a\ncompaction of the cluster during the expulsion phase and reduces the SFE needed\nto form bound clusters to less than 10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2000 14:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Recent work in IR has been paying great\nattention to models which employ a logical approach; the advantage being that\none can have a simple computable characterization of retrieval on the basis of\na pure logical analysis of retrieval.

We conclude that the quantum nature of the entire process is\ndefined by its global geometry, which is enforced by a macroscopic finite size\nof the colliding objects. In this paper, we study the qualitative aspects of\nthe theory and review its development in two subsequent papers. Our key result\nis that the effective mass of the quark in the expanding system formed in the\ncollision of the two nuclei is gradually built up reaching its maximum by the\ntime the quark mode becomes sufficiently localized. The chromo-magneto-static\ninteraction of the color currents flowing in the rapidity direction is the main\nmechanism which is responsible for the generation of the effective mass of the\nsoft quark mode and therefore, for the physical scale at the earliest stage of\nthe collision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2000 17:54:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We demonstrate that it is possible to identify which of these two\nstates the system is in by means of local operations and classical\ncommunication alone. The protocol we outline is both completely reliable and\ncompletely general - it will correctly distinguish any two orthogonal states\n100% of the time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2000 16:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The particles - excitation are concentrated in space of a \"reciprocal\nlattice \" of discrete medium.
