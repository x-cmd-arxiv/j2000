Models of this\nreflected spectrum generally assume that the accretion disk can be\ncharacterized by material in a single ionization state. However, several\nauthors have recently stressed the importance of the classic ionization\ninstability for X-ray irradiated gas in hydrostatic balance. This instability\nleads to a discontinuous transition in the vertical structure of the disk,\nresulting in a hot ionized skin above much cooler material. If the Compton\ntemperature of the skin is high then even iron is completely ionized, and the\nskin does not produce any spectral features. These new models, where the\nionization structure of the disk is calculated self-consistently, require an\nexcessive amount of computing power and so are difficult to use in directly\nfitting observed X-ray spectra. Instead, we invert the problem by simulating\nX-ray spectra produced by the new reflection models, and then fit these with\nthe old, single zone reflection models, to assess the extent to which the\nderived accretion geometry depends on the reflection model used. We find that\nthe single zone ionization models can severely underestimate the covering\nfraction of the ``cold'' material as seen from the X-ray source if the optical\ndepth in the ionized skin is of order unity, and that this can produce an\napparent correlation between the covering fraction and the X-ray spectral index\nsimilar in nature to that reported by Zdziarski, Lubinski and Smith (1999).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2000 14:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

How to measure tan$\\beta$ and the soft parameters is examined via a\nnumber of applications, and the difficulty of measuring tan$\\beta$ at hadron\ncolliders is explained. In each case the important role of soft phases is made\nexplicit, and the true number of parameters is counted. Applications include\nthe chargino and neutralino sectors, the Higgs sector and how its results\nchange when phases are included, measuring the (relative) gluino phase, CP\nviolation in K and B systems and whether all CP violation can be due to soft\nphases, how to learn if the LSP is the cold dark matter of the universe, and\nbaryogenesis. It is emphasized that the success of supersymmetry in explaining\nthe breaking of electroweak symmetry is probably its most important\nachievement, and implications of that explanation for superpartner masses are\nshown. Combining many of these considerations, a further application argues\nthat a lepton collider of total energy 600 GeV with a polarized beam is one we\ncan be confident will do important physics even after LHC. The question of the\norigins of CP violation, whether the CKM phase can be zero, and the possibility\nthat the soft phases can tell us about compactification and supersymmetry\nbreaking are discussed.

We show that results thus obtained for frequency dependent\npolarizabilities of the inert gas atoms are highly acurate. On the other hand,\npolarizabilities of the alkaline earths are not given with the same accuracy.\nIn light of this, we make an assessment of ALDA for obtaining linear and\nnonlinear response properties by employing time-dependent density-functional\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2000 10:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
