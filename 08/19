We also proposed a dense\nmedium model for some afterglows, e.g., the steepening in the light curve of\nthe R-band afterglow of GRB 990123 may be caused by the adiabatic shock which\nhas evolved from an ultrarelativistic phase to a nonrelativistic phase in a\ndense medium.

A\nshock in a dense medium becomes nonrelativistic rapidly after a short\nrelativistic phase. The afterglow from the shock at the nonrelativistic stage\ndecays more rapidly than at the relativistic stage.

However, the relation between the galaxy and\nmass density fields depends on the complex physics of galaxy formation, and it\ncan in general be non-linear, stochastic, and perhaps non-local. The\none-parameter linear bias model is almost certainly oversimplified, which leads\nto the obvious question: What is the quantity beta that is actually measured by\ndifferent techniques? To address this question, we estimate beta from galaxy\ndistributions that are constructed by applying a variety of locally biased\ngalaxy formation models to cosmological N-body simulations. We compare the\nvalues of beta estimated using three different techniques: a density-density\ncomparison similar to the POTENT analysis, a velocity-velocity comparison\nsimilar to the VELMOD analysis, and an anisotropy analysis of the\nredshift-space power spectrum. In most cases, we find that beta estimated using\nall three methods is similar to the asymptotic value of\nOmega^{0.6}/b_{sigma}(R) at large R, where b_{sigma}(R) is the ratio of rms\ngalaxy fluctuations to rms mass fluctuations on scale R. Thus, something close\nto the conventional interpretation of beta continues to hold even for complex\nbias models. Moreover, we find that beta estimates made using these three\nmethods should, in principle, agree with each other. It is thus unlikely that\nnon-linear or scale-dependent bias is responsible for the discrepancies that\nexist among current measurements of beta from different techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2000 00:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-23"}

The\nconstructed solution is applied to the study of various geometric effects on\nthe generation and propagation of electromagnetic wave tails to first order in\nthe Riemann tensor. Generally the received radiation tail occurs after a time\ndelay which represents geometrical backscattering by the central gravitational\nsource. It is shown that the truly nonlocal wave-propagation correction (the\ntail term) takes a universal form which is independent of multipole order. In a\nparticular case, if the radiation pulse is generated by the source during a\nfinite time interval, the tail term after the primary pulse is entirely\ndetermined by the energy-momentum vector of the gravitational field source: the\nform of the tail term is independent of the multipole structure of the\ngravitational source.

We derive\nquantitative predictions for various integrated observables in B->K^*mu^+mu^-\ndecay in the presence of physics beyond the SM with additional CP phases and an\nextended operator basis. In particular, a model-independent analysis of CP\nasymmetries that require the presence of unitarity phases, in addition to CP\nviolation, is performed. We find that in the low dimuon invariant mass region\n2m_mu<M_{mu^+mu^-}<M_{J/psi}, the CP asymmetries are highly suppressed by small\ndynamical phases, assuming that new physics is unlikely to significantly alter\nthe Wilson coefficients of the operators governing two-body hadronic B decays.\nTaking into account current experimental data on the measured b->s gamma rate\nand the upper limit on BR(B^0->K^{*0}mu^+mu^-), CP-violating effects of a few\nper cent are estimated, even in the presence of new physics with CP phases of\nO(1). By contrast, in the high dimuon invariant mass region\nM_{psi'}<M_{mu^+mu^-}<(M_B-M_{K^*}) significant CP-violating effects are\npossible. Given a branching ratio of 1.8 x 10^{-6}, the CP asymmetries can be\nquite substantial (\\sim 20% or more), and thus may serve as a means of\ndiscovering physics transcending the SM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2000 22:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2000 15:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-23"}

To this end a theoretical model has been developed, which\nindicates that protons under the combined influence of strong space charge\nforces and periodic focussing in a linear transport channel can be kicked into\nhalo orbits. However, no experimental measurements of beam halo in proton beams\nhave yet been carried out. In this paper we report the progress of an effort to\ncarry out an experiment to measure beam-halo using the existing high- intensity\nproton beam of the LEDA facility. A linear transport channel has been assembled\nwith the appropriate diagnostics for measuring the expected small beam\ncomponent in the beam halo as a function of beam parameters. The experiment is\nbased on the use of an array of high-dynamic-range wire and beam scrapers to\ndetermine the halo and core profiles along the transport channel. Details of\nthe experimental design, the expected halo measurement properties will be\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2000 18:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Therefore, the computational efforts can be dramatically\nreduced.\n  However, in the framework of the standard nodeless radially local RECP\nversions, any attempt to extend the space of explicitly treated electrons more\nthan some limit does not improve the accuracy of the calculations. The errors\ncaused by these (nodeless) RECPs can range up to 2000 $cm^{-1}$ and more for\nthe dissociation and transition energies even for lowest-lying excitations that\ncan be unsatisfactory for many applications. Moreover, the direct calculation\nof such properties as electronic densities near heavy nuclei, hyperfine\nstructure, and matrix elements of other operators singular on heavy nuclei is\nimpossible as a result of the smoothing of the orbitals in the core regions.\n  In the present paper, ways to overcome these disadvantages of the RECP method\nare discussed.

We find that the\nrelativistic solution rapidly evanesces within a depth $2x_p$ inside the\npotential, where $x_p$ is the penetration length of the stationary solution.\nBeyond the characteristic distance $2x_p$, a Sommerfeld-type precursor travels\nalong the potential at the speed of light, $c$. However, no spatial propagation\nof a main wavefront along the structure is observed. We also find a non-causal\ntime evolution of the wavefront peak. The effect is only an apparent violation\nof Einstein causality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2000 07:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
