These forces can significantly effect the beam when a long linac composed\nof identical cells is assembled. Recent techniques in computational modeling,\nsimulation, and experiments for 20 MeV DARHT-II (Dual Axis Radiographic\nHydrodynamic Test) accelerator cells were found to reduce the wakefield\nimpedance of the cells from 800 ohms/meter to 350 ohms/meter and experimental\nresults confirm the results of the modeling efforts. Increased performance of\nthe cell was obtained through a parametric study of the accelerator structure,\nmaterials, material tuning, and geometry. As a result of this effort, it was\nfound that thickness-tuned ferrite produced a 50% deduction in the wakefield\nimpedance in the low frequency band and was easily tunable based on the\nmaterial thickness. It was also found that shaped metal sections allow for\nhigh-Q resonances to be de-tuned, thus decreasing the amplitude of the\nresonance and increasing the cell s performance. For the geometries used for\nthis cell, a roughly 45 degree angle had the best performance in affecting the\nwakefield modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2000 01:18:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2000 18:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
