The\nfinal goal is the reconstruction of the Higgs potential and thus the\nverification of the Higgs mechanism. MSSM Higgs boson production processes at\nfuture $\\gamma\\gamma$ colliders are calculated in several decay channels. Heavy\nscalar and pseudoscalar Higgs bosons can be discovered in the $b\\bar{b}$ final\nstate in the investigated mass range 200 to 800 GeV for moderate and large\nvalues of $\\tan\\beta$. The $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channel provides a heavy Higgs boson\ndiscovery potential for large values of $\\tan\\beta$. Several mechanisms that\ncan be exploited at $e^+e^-$ linear colliders for the measurement of the\nlifetime of a SM Higgs boson in the intermediate mass range are analysed. In\nthe $WW$ mode, the lifetime of Higgs scalars with masses below $\\sim 160$ GeV\ncan be determined with an error less than 10%. The reconstruction of the Higgs\npotential requires the measurement of the Higgs self-couplings. The SM and MSSM\ntrilinear Higgs self-couplings are accessible in double and triple Higgs\nproduction.
