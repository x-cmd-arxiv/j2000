Since its formulation in the early 1980s, analogical modeling has\nbeen successfully applied to a variety of problems in language. Several\nstriking similarities between quantum mechanics and analogical modeling have\nrecently been noted: (1) traditional statistics can be derived from a\nnon-statistical basis by assuming data occurrences are accessed through a\nspin-up state (given two equally probable quantum states, spin-up and\nspin-down); (2) the probability of predicting a particular outcome is\ndetermined by the squaring of an underlying linear measure and is the result of\ndecoherence (which occurs when a quantum system is observed); and (3) a natural\nmeasure of certainty (called the agreement) is based on one chance of guessing\nthe right outcome and corresponds to the integrated squaring of Schroedinger's\nwave equation.\n  Analogical modeling considers all possible combiantions of a given context of\nn variables, which is classical terms leads to an exponential explosion on the\norder of 2**n.
