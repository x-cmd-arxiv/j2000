This leads to a systematic\nshift of the supernova Ia progenitor population. Firstly, while for Z=0.02\ndonor star initial masses in supernova progenitor systems are restricted to the\nrange 1.6...2.3 M_sun, they are in the interval 1.4...1.8 M_sun at low Z.\nSecondly, the initial white dwarf masses need, on average, to be larger by 0.2\nM_sun at low Z in order to obtain a Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. This\nmetallicity dependences may be responsible for a drop of the Type Ia supernova\nrate for low metallicity, and may introduce a Z-dependence in the properties of\nsupernovae. We also estimate the X-ray luminosities of the computed systems,\nand investigate their donor star and orbital properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2000 07:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This involves to segment the sequence into \"words\". The\ndifficulty is to distinguish good segmentation from enormous number of random\nones.Aiming at revealing the nonrandomness of the sequence as strongly as\npossible, by applying maximum likelihood method, we find a quantity called\nSegmentation Entropy that can be used to fulfill the duty. Contrary to\ncommonplace where maximum entropy principle was applied to obtain good\nsolution, we choose to {\\em minimize} the segmentation entropy to obtain good\nsegmentation. The concept developed in this letter can be used to study the\nnoncoding DNA sequences, e.g., for regulatory elements prediction, in eukaryote\ngenomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2000 07:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

A CCD driver system widely used before consisted of an analog\nmultiplexer (MPX), a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and an operational\namplifier. A DAC is used to determine high and low voltage levels and the MPX\nselects each voltage level using a TTL clock. In this kind of driver board, it\nis difficult to reduce the noise caused by a short of high and low level in MPX\nand also to select many kinds of different voltage levels. Recent developments\nin semiconductor IC enable us to use a very fast sampling ($\\sim$ 10MHz) DAC\nwith low cost. We thus develop the new driver system using a fast DAC in order\nto determine both the voltage level of the clock and the clocking timing. We\nuse FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) to control the DAC. We have\nconstructed the data acquisition system and found that the CCD functions well\nwith our new system.
