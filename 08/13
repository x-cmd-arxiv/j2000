Aim of the present report is to show that yet another way to\novercome the above problem is accounting for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)\neffect. Namely, if the scalar (Higgs) field was presented by a single coherent\nquantum state at the initial instant of time, then its reduction during a phase\ntransition at some later instant should be correlated even at distances\nexceeding the local cosmological horizon. Consideration of a simplest\none-dimensional cosmological model with Z_2 Higgs field demonstrates that EPR\ncorrelations can substantially reduce the probability of spontaneous creation\nof the domain walls, and such effect seems to be even more promising in the\ncases of two- and three-dimensional geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2000 01:18:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
