The proximity accompanied by suppression of\ncoherence takes place in an inhomogeneous way in the momentum space in\nfinite-dimensional systems. Studies on instabilities of metals consisted of\nsuch differentiated electrons in the momentum space are reviewed from a general\npoint of view. A typical example of the differentiation is found in the\nflattening of the quasiparticle dispersion discovered around momenta $(\\pi,0)$\nand $(0,\\pi)$ on 2D square lattices. This flattening even controls the\ncriticality of the metal-insulator transition. Such differentiation and\nsuppressed coherence subsequently cause an instability to the superconducting\nstate in the second order of the strong coupling expansion. The d-wave pairing\ninteraction is generated from such local but kinetic processes in the absence\nof disturbance from the coherent single-particle excitations. The\nsuperconducting mechanism emerges from a direct kinetic origin which is\nconceptually different from the pairing mechanism mediated by bosonic\nexcitations as in magnetic, excitonic, and BCS mechanisms. Pseudogap phenomena\nwidely observed in the underdoped cuprates are then naturally understood from\nthe mode-mode coupling of d-wave superconducting (dSC) fluctuations repulsively\ncoupled with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ones.

(This is not to be confused with global analysis.) The nonlocal\nformulation of physics in \\cite{principia} points to a fresh viewpoint in\nmathematics: Nonlocal viewpoint. It involves analyzing objects of geometry and\nanalysis using nonlocal methods, as opposed to the classical local methods,\ne.g., Newton's calculus. It also involves analyzing new nonlocal geometries and\nnonlocal analytical objects, i.e. nonlocal fields. In geometry, we introduce\nand study (nonlocal) forms, differentials, integrals, connections, curvatures,\nholonomy, G-structures, etc. In analysis, we analyze local fields using\nnonlocal methods (semilocal analysis); nonlocal fields nonlocally (of course);\nand the connection between nonlocal linear analysis and local nonlinear\nanalysis. Analysis and geometry are next synthesized to yield nonlocal (hence\nnoncommutative) homology, cohomology, de Rham theory, Hodge theory, Chern-Weil\ntheory, K-theory (called N-theory) and index theory. Applications include\ntheorems such as nonlocal-noncommutative Riemann-Roch, Gauss-Bonnet, Hirzebruch\nsignature, etc. The nonlocal viewpoint is also investigated in algebraic\ngeometry, analytic geometry, and, to some extent, in arithmetic geometry,\nresulting in powerful bridges between the classical and nonlocal-noncommutative\naspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2000 16:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
