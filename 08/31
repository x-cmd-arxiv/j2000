Without a magnetic field, the front should\nbe quickly disturbed by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability arising from\ntangential motion of gas layers. However, Chandra image shows that the front is\nstable within a +-30deg sector in the direction of the cloud motion, beyond\nwhich it gradually disappears. We suggest that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nwithin the +-30deg sector is suppressed by surface tension of the magnetic\nfield whose field lines are parallel to the front.

Magnetic field near the front is expected to be stronger and\nhave very different structure compared to the bulk of the intergalactic medium,\nbecause the field lines are stretched by the tangential gas motions. Such a\nmagnetic configuration, once formed, would effectively stop the plasma\ndiffusion and heat conduction across the front, and may inhibit gas mixing\nduring the subcluster merger.

The global (9kpc by 2.5kpc) value of\nthe 12CO/13CO ratio is high at 20 - 40.

Starting with a modular map and recent\ntranscendence results for its values, we regard a mirror map $z(q)$ as a\nconcept generalizing the modular one. We give an alternative approach\ndemonstrating the existence of non-linear differential equations for the mirror\nmap, and exploit both an elegant construction of Klemm-Lian-Roan-Yau and the Ax\ntheorem to prove that the Yukawa coupling $K(q)$ does not satisfy any algebraic\ndifferential equation of order less than 7 with coefficients from\n$\\mathbb{C}(q)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2000 15:39:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2000 11:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
