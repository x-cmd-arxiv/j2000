This method of density estimation has been known\nin Statistics for some time but has not been implemented because of the large\ncomputational cost. Herein, we detail an implementation of the Mixture Model\ndensity estimation based on multi-resolutional KD-trees which makes this\nstatistical technique into a computationally tractable problem. We provide the\ntheoretical and experimental background for using a mixture model of Gaussians\nbased on the Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm. Applying these analyses\nto simulated data sets we show that the EM algorithm - using the AIC penalized\nlikelihood to score the fit - out-performs the best kernel density estimate of\nthe distribution while requiring no ``fine--tuning'' of the input algorithm\nparameters. We find that EM can accurately recover the underlying density\ndistribution from point processes thus providing an efficient adaptive\nsmoothing method for astronomical source catalogs. To demonstrate the general\napplication of this statistic to astrophysical problems we consider two cases\nof density estimation: the clustering of galaxies in redshift space and the\nclustering of stars in color space. From these data we show that EM provides an\nadaptive smoothing of the distribution of galaxies in redshift space\n(describing accurately both the small and large-scale features within the data)\nand a means of identifying outliers in multi-dimensional color-color space\n(e.g. for the identification of high redshift QSOs).

This spot is\nwhere an energetic electron beam interacts with a high Z target. The material\n(the \"roll bar\") is slightly curved to avoid alignment problems. The roll bar\nis constructed and positioned so that the x-rays are shadowed in the horizontal\nand vertical directions, so information is obtained in two dimensions. If a\nbeam profile is assumed (or measured by other means), the equivalent x-ray spot\nsize can be calculated from the x-ray shadow cast by the roll bar. Thus the\nellipticity of the beam can be calculated, assuming the ellipse of the x-ray\nspot is aligned with the roll bar. The data is recorded using a scintillator\nand gated camera. Data will be presented from measurements using the ETA II\ninduction LINAC. The accuracy of the measurement is checked using small\nelliptical targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2000 17:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is pointed out that this scheme\ncaptures both Bernstein & Vazirani's inner-product protocol, as well as\nGrover's search algorithm.\n  In the second part of the article we consider Paley's construction of\nHadamard matrices, which relies on the properties of quadratic characters over\nfinite fields.
