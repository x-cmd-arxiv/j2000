In addition, for most stars,\nrotational velocities were derived from CORAVEL observations. By comparing\nchromospheric emission in the cluster stars we confirm that chromospheric\nactivity depends on T_eff, and mass, when intermediate mass stars (M~4 Msun)\nare considered. The Hyades and Praesepe clump giants show the same level of\nactivity, as expected from stars with similar masses and T_effs. A difference\nof up to 0.4 dex in the chromospheric fluxes among the Hyades giants is\nrecorded and this sets a clear limit to the intrinsic spread of stellar\nactivity in evolved giants. Among the field stars none of the giants with\n(V-R)<0.4 and Ia supergiants observed shows a signature of Ca II activity. We\nfind that chromospheric activity scales linearly with stellar rotational\nvelocity and a high power of stellar effective temperature: F'_k propto\nT_eff^7.7 Vsini^0.9. This result can be interpreted as the effect of two\nchromospheric components of different nature: one mechanical and one magnetic.\nFor each range of masses activity can simply be expressed as a function of only\none parameter: either the T_eff or the angular rotation Omega. For the 1.6-3\nsolar mass stars the data are consistent with I Omega=const, while lower and\nhigher masses follow a law similar to I Omega^2=const.
