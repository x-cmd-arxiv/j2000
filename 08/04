In particular, the similarity of the\nspectra of the quasar pairs appears to be an artifact of the generic nature of\nquasar spectra. The two ambiguous pairs discovered as part of the Large Bright\nQuasar Survey (Q 1429-053 and Q 2153-0256) are analysed using principle\ncomponents analysis, which shows that their spectral similarities are not\ngreater than expected for a randomly chosen pair of quasars from the survey.\nThe assumption of the binary hypothesis allows the dynamics, time-scales and\nseparation distribution of binary quasars to be investigated and constrained.\nThe most plausible model is that the quasars' activity is triggered by tidal\ninteractions in a galatic merger, but that the (re-)activation of the galactic\nnuclei occurs quite late in the interaction, when the nuclei are within 80+/-30\nkpc of each other. A simple dynamical friction model for the decaying orbits\nreproduces the observed distribution of projected separations, but the decay\ntime inferred is comparable to a Hubble time.

This observation, which has\nbeen called a ``cornerstone'' of algebraic geometry ([GH, p.~62]), is a simple\nconsequence of the fact that analytic varieties carry a natural orientation.\nRecast in terms of linking numbers, it is our principal motivation. It implies\nthe following: Let $M$ be a smooth oriented compact 3-manifold in $\\Bbb C^3$.\nSuppose that $M$ bounds a bounded complex 2-variety $V$. Here ``bounds'' means,\nin the sense of Stokes' theorem, i.e., that ${b[V]}={[M]}$ as currents. Let $A$\nbe an algebraic curve in $\\Bbb C^3$ which is disjoint from M. Consider the\nlinking number ${\\rm link}(M,A)$ of $M$ and $A$. Since this linking number is\nequal to the intersection number (i.e. the sum of the intersection indices) of\n$V$ and $A$, by the positivity of these intersection indices, we have ${\\rm\nlink}(M,A) \\geq 0$. The linking number will of course be 0 if $V$ and $A$ are\ndisjoint. (As $A$ is not compact, this usage of ``linking number'' will be\nclarified later.) This reasoning shows more generally that ${\\rm link}(M,A)\n\\geq 0$ if $M$ bounds a positive holomorphic 2-chain. Recall that a {\\it\nholomorphic $k$-chain} in $\\Omega \\subseteq \\Bbb C^n$ is a sum $\\sum n_j [V_j]$\nwhere $\\{V_j\\}$ is a locally finite family of irreducible $k$-dimensional\nsubvarieties of $\\Omega$ and $n_j \\in \\Bbb Z$ and that the holomorphic 2-chain\nis {\\it positive} if $n_j >0$ for all $j$.

In some good cases, enumerative invariants\n(which are manifestly integers) can be expressed as a rational combination of\nGromov-Witten invariants. Pandharipande speculated that the same combination of\ninvariants should yield integers even when they do not have any enumerative\nsignificance on the 3-fold. In the case when the 3-fold is the product of a\ncomplex surface and an elliptic curve, Pandharipande has computed this\ncombination of invariants on the 3-fold in terms of the Gromov-Witten\ninvariants of the surface. This computation yields surprising conjectural\npredictions about the genus 0 and genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of complex\nsurfaces. The conjecture states that certain rational combinations of the genus\n0 and genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants are always integers. Since the\nGromov-Witten invariants for surfaces are often enumerative (as oppose to\n3-folds), this conjecture can often also be interpreted as giving certain\ncongruence relations among the various enumerative invariants of a surface.\n  In this note, we state Pandharipande's conjecture and we prove it for an\ninfinite series of classes in the case of the projective plane blown-up at 9\npoints. In this case, we find generating functions for the numbers appearing in\nthe conjecture in terms of quasi-modular forms.

Analytically and\nnumerically a stability of the ``classical ground state'' (CGS) -- the vicinity\nof the point ($x=0, p=0$) -- is analyzed. In the quantum case, the method for\nstudying a stability of the quantum ground state (QGS) is suggested, based on\nthe quasienergy representation. The dynamics depends on four parameters: the\ndetuning from the resonance, $\\delta=\\ell-\\Omega/\\omega$, where $\\Omega$ and\n$\\omega$ are, respectively, the wave and the oscillator's frequencies; the\npositive integer (resonance) number, $\\ell$; the dimensionless Planck constant,\n$h$, and the dimensionless wave amplitude, $\\epsilon$. For $\\delta=0$, the CGS\nand the QGS are unstable for resonance numbers $\\ell=1, 2$. For small\n$\\epsilon$, the QGS becomes more stable with increasing $\\delta$ and decreasing\n$h$. When $\\epsilon$ increases, the influence of chaos on the stability of the\nQGS is analyzed for different parameters of the model, $\\ell$, $\\delta$ and\n$h$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2000 06:13:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2000 21:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
