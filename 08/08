Rate constants for collisions that drive molecules from\nweak-field-seeking to strong-field-seeking states are estimated using a simple\nmodel. The rates are found to be quite large, of order 10^{-12} - 10^{-10}\ncm^3/sec, and moreover to grow rapidly in an externally applied electric field.\nIt is argued that these results are generic for polar molecules, and that\ntherefore polar molecules should be trapped by other than electrostatic means.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2000 23:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The Backwards-Time Interpretation\n(BTI) tries to recover realism and locality by permitting backwards time\ncausality. BTI should permit dramatic simplification of the assumptions or\naxioms of physics, but requires new work in fundamental mathematics, such as\nnew tools for the \"closure of turbulence,\" the derivation of statistics\ngenerated by ODE or PDE.\n  Recent events like the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment of Kim, Shih\net al have increased mainstream interest in the possibility of backwards\ncausality. The Backwards Time Quantum Teleportation (BTQT) experiment will take\nthis further. True backwards time communication channels (BTCC) are absolutely\nimpossible in most formulations of quantum theory but only almost impossible in\nthe BTI formulation. This paper discusses BTQT, the issue of backwards\ncausality in different versions of quantum theory and new mathematical\ndevelopments. It defines a new object, the \"entropy matrix,\" which leads to\nclosure of turbulence for PDE systems. Predictions of a common toy field theory\n(real phi-3 QFT) are reproduced by the corresponding PDE model combined with a\nnew model of the micro/macro interface (2M/M).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2000 17:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
