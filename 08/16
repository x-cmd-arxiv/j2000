It is shown\nthat in the presence of the long-range interactions (I different from 0) the\nnature of the transition is strongly affected. For I>0, which favours the\nordering of the transverse components of the spins, the transition is changed\nfrom second- to first-order, due to the competition between transverse and xy\ncouplings. On the other hand, for I<0, which induces complete frustration of\nthe spins, a second-order transition is still present, although the system is\ndriven out of its usual universality class, and its critical exponents assume\ntypical mean-field values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2000 12:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Joss and Shannon proved in 1973 that a\nsequence of flipturns eventually transforms any simple polygon into a convex\npolygon. This paper describes several new results about such flipturn\nsequences. We show that any orthogonal polygon is convexified after at most n-5\narbitrary flipturns, or at most 5(n-4)/6 well-chosen flipturns, improving the\npreviously best upper bound of (n-1)!/2. We also show that any simple polygon\ncan be convexified by at most n^2-4n+1 flipturns, generalizing earlier results\nof Ahn et al. These bounds depend critically on how degenerate cases are\nhandled; we carefully explore several possibilities. We describe how to\nmaintain both a simple polygon and its convex hull in O(log^4 n) time per\nflipturn, using a data structure of size O(n). We show that although flipturn\nsequences for the same polygon can have very different lengths, the shape and\nposition of the final convex polygon is the same for all sequences and can be\ncomputed in O(n log n) time. Finally, we demonstrate that finding the longest\nconvexifying flipturn sequence of a simple polygon is NP-hard.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2000 04:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We therefore compute the graviton propagator in the gauge where only the\ngraviphoton fluctuations are set to zero (the diffeomorphisms necessary for\nthis gauge fixing are intact), but the graviscalar component is untouched. We\npoint out that in the Gaussian normal coordinates (where the graviscalar\ncomponent vanishes on the brane) the graviton propagator blows up in the\nultra-violet near the brane. In fact, the allowed gauge transformations, which\ndo not lead to such ultra-violet behavior of the graviton propagator, are such\nthat the coupling of the graviscalar to the brane matter cannot be gauged away\nin the ultra-violet. Because of this, at the quantum level, where we expect\nvarious additional terms to be generated in the brane world-volume action\nincluding those involving the graviscalar, fine-tuning (which is independent of\nthat for the brane cosmological constant) is generically required to preserve\nconsistent coupling between bulk gravity and brane matter.

An increase of more than two orders of\nmagnitude in particle number for the most heavy elements in the SIS had to be\ngained. Since that time the new High Current Injector (HSI) consisting of\nH-type RFQ and DTL-structures for dual beam operation was installed and\nsuccessfully commissioned. The High Charge Injector (HLI) supplied the main\nlinac during that time. Simultaneously conditioning and running in of the\nrf-transmitters and rf-structures were done. The HSI commissioning strategy\nincluded beam investigation after each transport and acceleration section,\nusing a versatile diagnostic test stand. Results of the extensive commissioning\nmeasurements (e.g. transverse emittance, bunch width, beam transmission) behind\nLEBT, RFQ, Super Lens, IH tank I and II and stripping section will be\ndiscussed. An 40Ar1+ beam coming from a MUCIS ion source was used to fill the\nlinac up to the theoretical space charge limit. Routine operation started in\nNovember 1999.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2000 15:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
