A\ncomparison of the derived masses for RRc stars in the four OoII clusters Omega\nCen, M15, M55 and M68 indicates that the masses of the RRc stars in M15 and M68\nare almost 0.2 solar masses greater than those in the other two. Since M15 and\nM68 have a high frequency of RRd stars among their first overtone pulsators,\nwhile none have been identified in Omega Cen or M55, this suggests that the\ndouble-mode pulsation phenomenon may be associated with mass. Among the RRc\nvariables in Omega Cen, the OoII variables have lower derived masses and higher\nluminosities than the OoI variables. An application of the period-density law\nto pairs of OoI and OoII RRab stars selected according to their position in the\nP-A plot also indicates that the OoII variables in general have lower masses\nand higher luminosities. These findings support the hypothesis that RR Lyrae\nvariables in OoII systems are evolved HB stars that spend their ZAHB phase on\nthe blue side of the instability strip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2000 13:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The strenght of these\ninteractions depend strongly on the orientation of the field, a feature which\ncan be exploited to detect chiral effects experimentally. In many spin systems,\nthese chiral interactions are generated and should be taken into account before\nany comparison with experiments can be made. We study the effect of the chiral\ninteractions on certain quasi-one-dimensional gapped spin half systems and show\nthat they can potentially alter the physics expected from the Pauli coupling\nalone. In particular, we demonstrate that these terms alter the universality\nclass of the C-IC transition in spin-tubes. More interestingly, in weakly\ncoupled XX zig-zag ladders, we find that the field induced chiral term can\nclose the singlet gap and drive a second order transition in the non-magnetic\nsinglet sector, which manifests itself as a two component Luttinger liquid-like\nbehaviour in the spin correlation functions.

We make a detailed study of the observables\nrelated to LFV in different RPV models, and compare them to the expectations of\nR-conserving supersymmetry with heavy right-handed neutrinos. We show that the\npredictions are vastly different and uniquely characterise each model, thus\nproviding a powerful framework for experimentally distinguishing between\ndifferent theories of LFV. Besides the obvious possibility of amplified\ntree-level generation of mu -> eee and mu -> e conversion in nuclei, we find\nthat even in the case where these processes arise at the one-loop level, their\nrates are comparable to that of mu -> e gamma, in clear contrast to the\npredictions of R-conserving models. We conclude that in order to distinguish\nbetween the different models, such a combined study of all the LFV processes is\nnecessary, and that measuring P-odd asymmetries in polarised mu -> eee can play\na decisive role.
