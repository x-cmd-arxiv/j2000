This structure can be identified\nwith a bar. The length of this structure scaled by the length of the bulge\ncorrelates with the morphologically classified shape of the bulge.

The first approach, called\nquantitative constraint logic programming, is conceptualized in a clear logical\nframework, and presents a sound and complete system of quantitative inference\nfor definite clauses annotated with subjective weights. This approach combines\na rigorous formal semantics for quantitative inference based on subjective\nweights with efficient weight-based pruning for constraint-based systems. The\nsecond approach, called probabilistic constraint logic programming, introduces\na log-linear probability distribution on the proof trees of a constraint logic\nprogram and an algorithm for statistical inference of the parameters and\nproperties of such probability models from incomplete, i.e., unparsed data. The\npossibility of defining arbitrary properties of proof trees as properties of\nthe log-linear probability model and efficiently estimating appropriate\nparameter values for them permits the probabilistic modeling of arbitrary\ncontext-dependencies in constraint logic programs. The usefulness of these\nideas is evaluated empirically in a small-scale experiment on finding the\ncorrect parses of a constraint-based grammar. In addition, we address the\nproblem of computational intractability of the calculation of expectations in\nthe inference task and present various techniques to approximately solve this\ntask. Moreover, we present an approximate heuristic technique for searching for\nthe most probable analysis in probabilistic constraint logic programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2000 13:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nblack hole sector therefore arises as a mixed Higgs-Coulomb branch of an\neffective 1+1 dimensional gauge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2000 16:43:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2000 15:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The\nupper bound is controlled by the structural complexity of the interacting\nparticles---a quantity which is defined here and which measures the amount of\nspatio-temporal information that a particle stores. Along the way we establish\na number of properties of domains and particles that follow from the\ncomputational mechanics analysis of cellular automata; thereby elucidating why\nthat approach is of general utility. The upper bound is tested against several\nrelatively complex domain-particle cellular automata and found to be tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2000 23:28:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2000 01:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 2001 02:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We argue, that any operational formulation of\nquantum theory needs an algebra of observables and an object that incorporates\nthe information about relative phases and probabilities. The latter is the\n(de)coherence functional, introduced by the consistent histories approach to\nquantum theory. The acceptance of relative phases as a primitive ingredient of\nany quantum theory, liberates us from the need to use a Hilbert space and\nnon-commutative observables. It is shown, that quantum phenomena are adequately\ndescribed by a theory of relative phases and non-additive probabilities on the\nclassical phase space. The only difference lies on the type of observables that\ncorrespond to sharp measurements. This class of theories does not suffer from\nthe consequences of Bell's theorem (it is not a theory of Kolmogorov\nprobabilities) and Kochen- Specker's theorem (it has distributive \"logic\").
