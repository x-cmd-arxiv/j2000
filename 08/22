The calculations include inelastic\nelectron scattering due to electron-lattice interaction. The coupling between\nthe electron and the lattice is crucial to determine the transport properties\nin one-dimensional systems subject to Peierls transition since it drives the\ntransition itself. The electron-phonon coupling is treated as a quantum\ncoherent process, in the sense that no random dephasing due to electron-phonon\ninteractions is introduced in the scattering wave functions. We show that\ncharge carrier injection, even in the tunneling regime, induces lattice\ndistortions localized around the tunneling electron. The transport in the\nmolecular wire is due to polaron-like propagation. We show typical examples of\nthe lattice distortions induced by charge injection into the wire. In the\ntunneling regime, the electron transmission is strongly enhanced in comparison\nwith the case of elastic scattering through the undistorted molecular wire.

This may\nplay a role in displaying the symmetries and constructing the dynamics of\nlittle understood systems, such as M-theory. 2T physics describes various 1T\ndynamical systems as different d-dimensional ``holographic'' views of the same\n2T system in $d+2$ dimensions. The ``holography'' is due to gauge symmetries\nthat tend to reduce the number of effective dimensions. Different 1T evolutions\n(i.e. different Hamiltonians) emerge from the same 2T theory when gauge fixing\nis done with different embeddings of d dimensions inside d+2 dimensions. Thus,\nin the 2T setting, the distinguished 1T which we call ``time'' is a gauge\ndependent concept. The 2T action has also a global SO(d,2) symmetry in flat\nspacetime, or a more general d+2 symmetry in curved spacetime, under which all\ndimensions are on an equal footing. This symmetry is observable in many 1T\nsystems, but it remained unknown until discovered in the 2T formalism. 2T\nphysics has mainly been developed in the context of particles, including spin\nand supersymmetry, but some advances have also been made with strings and\np-branes, and insights for M-theory have already emerged.

These vector and scalar\npotentials were calculated using the quark meson coupling model.

A reasonable agreement is found, but VMD tends to underestimate the\ncoupling constants.
