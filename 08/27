This, in turn, has an important influence\non the effective forces for larger distances which are considerably reduced as\ncompared to the prediction based on the primitive model. When these forces are\nrepulsive, the long-distance behaviour can be described by an effective Yukawa\npair potential with a solvent-renormalized charge. As a function of colloidal\nvolume fraction and added salt concentration, this solvent-renormalized charge\nbehaves qualitatively similar to that obtained via the Poisson-Boltzmann cell\nmodel but there are quantitative differences. For divalent counterions and\nnano-sized colloids, on the other hand, the hydration may lead to overscreened\ncolloids with mutual attraction while the primitive model yields repulsive\nforces. All these new effects can be accounted for through a solvent-averaged\nprimitive model (SPM) which is obtained from the full model by integrating out\nthe solvent degrees of freedom. The SPM was used to access larger colloidal\nparticles without simulating the solvent explicitly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2000 01:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
