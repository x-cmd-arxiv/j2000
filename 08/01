In the atmosphere, if the magnetic field lines\nare inclined sufficiently to the vertical, a magnetocentrifugal outflow is\ndriven and passes through a slow magnetosonic point close to the surface. We\ndetermine how the rate of mass loss varies with the strength and inclination of\nthe magnetic field. In particular, we find that for disks in which the mean\npoloidal field is sufficiently strong to stabilize the disk against the\nmagnetorotational instability, the mass loss rate decreases extremely rapidly\nwith increasing field strength, and is maximal at an inclination angle of 40-50\ndegrees. For turbulent disks with weaker mean fields, the mass loss rate\nincreases monotonically with increasing strength and inclination of the field,\nbut the solution branch terminates before achieving excessive mass loss rates.\nOur results suggest that efficient jet launching occurs for a limited range of\nfield strengths, and a limited range of inclination angles in excess of 30\ndegrees.

In the Part one the field-to-particle transition\nformalism is applied to the sigma model (string), dilaton gravity and gauged\nsupergravity 0-brane solutions. In addition to the fact that the\nfield-to-particle transition is of interest itself it can be regarded also as\nthe dynamical dimensional reduction which takes into account field fluctuations\nas well as one can treat it as the method of the consistent quantization in the\nvicinity of the nontrivial vacuum induced by a field solution. It is shown that\nin all the cases the end product of the approach is the so-called \"non-minimal\npoint particle\". In view of this it is conjectured that point particles are not\nonly the end product but also the underlying base of modern high-energy theory\neven more fundamental than the strings. The Part two is hence devoted to the\nformal axiomatics of the string-brane approach - there we deepen the\nabove-mentioned conjecture. It turns out that a point particle can be regarded\nas an extended object from the viewpoint of a macroscopic measurement. The\nparticle is actually observed as the ``cloud'' consisting of the virtual paths\nand nothing prevents their deviations from the classical trajectory. Therefore,\nfor an observer the real particle can be no more viewed as a point object.\nHowever, it cannot be supposed also as a continuous extended object unless we\naverage over all the deviations. Then we obtain the metabrane, which is the\ncomposite extended object consisting of the microscopical objects (strings) and\ncosmological-size ones (3-brane) where the size of a corresponding embedding is\ngoverned by the weight constants arising along with the decomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2000 05:10:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2001 00:57:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2001 04:12:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In addition, we investigate\nconditional, state-dependent and approximate quantum deleting of unknown\nstates.
