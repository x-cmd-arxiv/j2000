We use\nthese states to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and find the\nmagnetization of the molecule in the presence of a slowly varying magnetic\nfield. We study the effects of the field sweep rate, fourth order anisotropic\nspin interactions and a transverse field on the weights of the different states\nas well as the magnetization steps which are known to occur in the hysteresis\nplots in this system. We find that the fourth order term and a slow field sweep\nrate are crucial for obtaining prominent steps in magnetization in the\nhysteresis plots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2000 08:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
