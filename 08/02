A GHRS spectrogram of the ionizing star yields a spectral type\nof about O7 for the star. The lack of P Cygni profiles for Si IV and C IV\nindicates that the star is not a supergiant. The nebular abundances in the\nionized gas are consistent with average abundances for LMC H II regions, with\nthe possible exception that nitrogen may be enhanced. Enrichment by a former\nevolved companion star is not evident. A long-slit echelle spectrogram in\nH-alpha + [N II] shows no evidence for high-velocity gas in N44C. This rules\nout high-velocity shocks as the source of the nebular He II emission. A 108 ks\nROSAT HRI image of N44C shows no X-ray point source to a 3-sigma upper limit\nL(X) < 10^34 erg s^-1 in the 0.1-2.0 keV band. Based on new measurements of the\nelectron density in the He II emitting region, we derive recombination\ntimescales of approximately 20 yrs for He^+2 and approximately 4 yrs for Ne^+4.\nIf N44C is a fossil X-ray ionized nebula, this places severe constraints on\nwhen the putative X-ray source could have turned off. The presence of strong\n[Ne IV] emission in the nebula is puzzling if the ionizing source has turned\noff. It is possible the system is related to the Be X-ray binaries, although\nthe O star in N44C does not show Be characteristics at the present time.\nMonitoring of X-rays and He II emission from the nebula, as well as a radial\nvelocity study of the ionizing star, are needed to fully understand the\nemission line spectrum of N44C.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2000 23:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Roughly stated, the\nconjecture says that, if the metrics are normalized to have constant diameter,\nthen this limit is the base of the conjectural special lagrangian torus\nfibration associated with the large complex structure limit, namely an\nn-sphere, and that the metric on this S^n is induced from a standard (singular)\nRiemannian metric on the base, the singularities of the metric corresponding to\nthe discriminant locus of the fibration.\n  This conjecture is trivially true for elliptic curves; in this paper we prove\nit in the case of K3 surfaces. Using the standard description of mirror\nsymmetry for K3 surfaces and the hyperk\\\"ahler rotation trick, we reduce the\nproblem to that of studying K\\\"ahler degenerations of elliptic K3 surfaces,\nwith the K\\\"ahler class approaching the wall of the K\\\"ahler cone corresponding\nto the fibration and the volume normalized to be one.
