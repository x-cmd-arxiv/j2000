We confirm in 3D flows the conclusion from our 2D work that even\napparently weak magnetic fields embedded in Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable plasma\nflows can be fundamentally important to nonlinear evolution of the instability.\nIn fact, that statement is strengthened in 3D by this work, because it shows\nhow field line bundles can be stretched and twisted in 3D as the quasi-2D Cat's\nEye vortex forms out of the hydrodynamical motions. In our simulations twisting\nof the field may increase the maximum field strength by more than a factor of\ntwo over the 2D effect. If, by these developments, the Alfv\\'en Mach number of\nflows around the Cat's Eye drops to unity or less, our simulations suggest\nmagnetic stresses will eventually destroy the Cat's Eye and cause the plasma\nflow to self-organize into a relatively smooth and apparently stable flow that\nretains memory of the original shear. For our flow configurations the regime in\n3D for such reorganization is $4\\lesssim M_{Ax} \\lesssim 50$, expressed in\nterms of the Alfv\\'en Mach number of the original velocity transition and the\ninitial Alfv\\'en speed projected to the flow plan. For weaker fields the\ninstability remains essentially hydrodynamic in early stages, and the Cat's Eye\nis destroyed by the hydrodynamic secondary instabilities of a 3D nature. Then,\nthe flows evolve into chaotic structures that approach decaying isotropic\nturbulence. In this stage, there is considerable enhancement to the magnetic\nenergy due to stretching, twisting, and turbulent amplification, which is\nretained long afterwards. The magnetic energy eventually catches up to the\nkinetic energy, and the nature of flows become magnetohydrodynamic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2000 16:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is a problem of some interest to find\nthe class of all relativistic cosmological models which are capable of\nproviding a reasonable `fit' to the universe. This thesis, in some respects, is\npart of this process. We consider Stephani models, which are a generalisation\nof the standard Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models, which can be\nthought of as FLRW models with acceleration and pressure gradients. Thus these\nmodels generalise the `dust' assumption of standard cosmology.\n  The crucial aspect of this work is the retention of the Copernican principle\n-- an assumption regarded by many as crucial to cosmology. It states that we\nare not at a special location in the universe. This is a vital aspect of the\noriginal work in this thesis: consideration of an inhomogeneous model, while\nretaining the Copernican principle has, as far as the author is aware, not been\nconsidered in detail before.\n  We start by generalising the Ehlers-Geren-Sachs Theorem to identify the class\nof inhomogeneous spacetimes which allow an isotropic radiation field for all\nobservers in the spacetime. We then investigate observational and physical\naspects of these models from all observer locations. We conclude that there\nexist spacetimes which conform to present observational constraints (especially\nanisotropy constraints) for any location in the spacetime, while at the same\ntime being significantly inhomogeneous; ie, not `almost-FLRW'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2000 22:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Apart from the\nfractional particles into which the electron breaks apart, there are\nnon-trivial gapped topological excitations - dubbed \"visons\".

The\nBoillat metric is S-duality invariant and conformal to the open string metric.\nIt also governs the propagation of scalars and spinors in Born-Infeld theory.\nWe discuss the potential clash between causality determined by the closed\nstring and open string light cones and find that the latter never lie outside\nthe former. Both cones touch along the principal null directions of the\nbackground Born-Infeld field. We consider black hole solutions in situations in\nwhich the distinction between bulk and brane is not sharp such as space filling\nbranes and find that the location of the event horizon and the thermodynamic\nproperties do not depend on whether one uses the closed or open string metric.\nAnalogous statements hold in the more general context of non-linear\nelectrodynamics or effective quantum-corrected metrics.
