Despite their limitations, selectional\nrestrictions have proven very useful in natural language applications, where\nthey have been used frequently in word sense disambiguation, syntactic\ndisambiguation, and anaphora resolution. Given their practical value, we\nexplore two methods to incorporate selectional restrictions in the HPSG theory,\nassuming that the reader is familiar with HPSG. The first method employs HPSG's\nBackground feature and a constraint-satisfaction component pipe-lined after the\nparser. The second method uses subsorts of referential indices, and blocks\nreadings that violate selectional restrictions during parsing. While\ntheoretically less satisfactory, we have found the second method particularly\nuseful in the development of practical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2000 07:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\ndemonstrate that the approximate asymmetry evolution equation obtained therein\nis an expansion, up to a minor discrepancy, of the well-established static\napproximation equation, valid only when the supposedly new higher order\ncorrection term is small. In the regime where this so-called ``back-reaction''\nterm is large and artificially terminates the asymmetry growth, their evolution\nequation ceases to be a faithful approximation to the Quantum Kinetic Equations\n(QKEs) simply because pure Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) transitions have\nbeen neglected. At low temperatures the MSW effect is the dominant asymmetry\namplifier. Neither the static nor the DHPS approach contains this important\nphysics. Therefore we conclude that the DHPS results have sufficient veracity\nat the onset of explosive asymmetry generation, but are invalid in the ensuing\nlow temperature epoch where MSW conversions are able to enhance the asymmetry\nto values of order $0.2 - 0.37$. DHPS do claim to find a significant final\nasymmetry for very large $\\delta m^2$ values.
