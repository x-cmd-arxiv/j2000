The phase transition from pure nucleonic matter to the\nkaon condensate phase is described using Gibbs' rules for phase equilibrium,\nwhich permit the existence of a mixed phase. A general property of neutron\nstars containing kaon condensates, as well as other forms of strangeness, is\nthat the maximum mass for cold, neutrino-free matter can be less than the\nmaximum mass for matter containing trapped neutrinos or which has a finite\nentropy. A proto-neutron star formed with a baryon mass exceeding that of the\nmaximum mass of cold, neutrino-free matter is therefore metastable, that is, it\nwill collapse to a black hole at some time during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling\nstage.\n  The effects of kaon condensation on metastable stars are dramatic.

Distinguished by a rich underlying Lie\nalgebraic structure these models have in recent years attracted much attention\nnot only as test laboratories for non-perturbative methods in quantum field\ntheory but also in the context of off-critical models. After a short\nintroduction the mathematical preliminaries such as root systems, Coxeter\ngeometry, dual algebras, q-deformed Coxeter elements and q-deformed Cartan\nmatrices are introduced. Using this mathematical framework the bootstrap\nanalysis of the affine Toda S-matrices with real coupling is performed and\nseveral universal Lie algebraic formulae proved.

The mechanism responsible for quantum\nrevivals in the present case is different from that in the non-linear\nwavepacket dynamics of systems such as Rydberg atoms. We interpret the reported\nphenomena as an optical analog of Bloch oscillations realized in Fock space and\npropose a feasible scheme for inducing Bloch oscillations in trapped ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2000 04:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
