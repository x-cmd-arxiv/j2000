We use\nfluid-dynamical models of gas flow in the barred galaxy NGC 4123 to constrain\nthe dynamical properties of the galaxy: disk M/L, bar pattern speed, and the\ncentral density and scale radius of the dark halo. We derive a realistic barred\npotential directly from the light distribution. For each model we assume a\nvalue of the stellar M/L and a bar pattern speed Omega_p and add a dark halo to\nfit the rotation curve. We then compute the gas flow velocities with a 2-D gas\ndynamical code, and compare the model flow patterns to a 2-D velocity field\nderived from Fabry-Perot observations. The strong shocks and non-circular\nmotions in the observed gas flow require a high stellar M/L and a fast-rotating\nbar. Models with I-band disk M/L of 2.0 -- 2.5 h_75, or 80 -- 100% of the\nmaximum disk value, are highly favored. The corotation radius of the bar must\nbe <= 1.5 times the bar semi-major axis.

The dark halo of NGC 4123 is less concentrated than favored by\ncurrent models of dark halos based on cosmological simulations. Since some 30%\nof bright disk galaxies are strongly barred and have dust lanes indicating\nshock morphology similar to that of NGC 4123, it is likely that they also have\nhigh stellar M/L and low density halos.

One of the most characteristic features of\nthe former is that the dust is divided in two main phases: molecular cloud\ncomplexes, where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar\nmedium. As a consequence, stellar populations of different ages have different\ngeometrical relationships with the two phases, which is essential in\nunderstanding several observed properties of galaxies, in particular those\nundergoing major episodes of star formation at any redshift. Indeed, our merged\nGRASIL+GALFORM model reproduces fairly well the SEDs of normal spirals and\nstarbursts from the far-UV to the sub-mm and their internal extinction\nproperties. In particular in the model the observed starburst attenuation law\n(Calzetti 1999) is accounted for as an effect of geometry of stars and dust,\nand has nothing to do with the optical properties of dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2000 14:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The flaton fields\nwhich break PQ symmetry are accompanied by flatinos, and the lightest flatino\n(the LSP) can be the stable, while the decay of the lightest neutralino (the\nNLSP) might be visible at colliders with a low axion scale. We examine the\ncosmology of these models, involving thermal inflation just after the PQ phase\ntransition. The branching ratio of flatons into axions must be small so as not\nto interfere with nucleosynthesis, and flatons must not decay into the LSP or\nit will be over-abundant. We explore a simple model,with light flatons which\ncan decay into $Z$ or $W$ bosons, or into a light Higgs ($h^0$) plus a $Z$\nboson, to show that such features can be realized in a wide range of parameter\nspace.
