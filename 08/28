The parameters\ndefining Hubble space are sufficiently robust to allow the formation of\nHubble's tuning fork to be mapped out to high redshifts. In the present paper,\nwe describe a preliminary investigation of the distribution of local galaxies\nin Hubble space, based on the CCD imaging atlas of Frei et al. (1996). We find\nthat barred, weakly-barred, and unbarred galaxies are remarkably well-separated\non this diagnostic diagram. The spiral sequence is clearly bimodal and indeed\napproximates a tuning fork: strongly-barred and unbarred spirals do not simply\nconstitute the extrema of a smooth unimodal distribution of bar strength, but\nrather populate two parallel sequences. Strongly barred galaxies lie on a\nremarkably tight sequence, strongly suggesting the presence of an underlying\nunifying physical process. Rather surprisingly, weakly barred systems do not\nseem to correspond to objects bridging the parameter space between unbarred and\nstrongly barred galaxies, but instead form an extension of the regular spiral\nsequence. This relation lends support to models in which the bulges of\nlate-type spirals originate from secular processes driven by bars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2000 02:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The method used is based on\nthe detection of the higher order Balmer lines and HeI lines in absorption and\nthe Wolf-Rayet feature at $\\sim$4680 \\AA in emission. These lines are strong\nindicators of the presence of young (a few Myrs) and intermediate-age (a few\n100 Myrs) stellar populations.

In\nthree others we detect a broad emission feature near 4680 \\AA that is most\nplausibly ascribed to a population of Wolf-Rayet stars (the evolved descendants\nof the most massive stars). We therefore conclude that the blue and near-UV\nlight of over half of the sample is dominated by young and/or intermediate age\nstars. The ``young'' Seyfert 2's have have larger far-IR luminosities, cooler\nmid/far-IR colors, and smaller [OIII]/H$\\beta$ flux ratios than the ``old''\nones. These differences are consistent with a starburst playing a significant\nenergetic role in the former class. We consider the possibility that there may\nbe two distinct sub-classes of Seyfert 2 nuclei (``starbursts'' and ``hidden\nBLR''). However, the fact that hidden BLRs have been found in three of the\n``young'' nuclei argues against this, and suggests that nuclear starbursts may\nbe a more general part of the Seyfert phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2000 06:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

Our\ncalculation of tilt responses indicates that, irrespective of the magnitude of\nthe field, the resulting glass phase, Josephson-vortex-glass (JG), should have\na transverse Meissner effect, as in a planar splayed glass phase, only for a\ntilt perpendicular to the layers. Further, focusing on the high field (and/or\nhigh anisotropy) region $B \\sqrt{\\Gamma} > \\phi_0/d^2$, where $\\Gamma$ is the\nmass anisotropy in the Lawrence-Doniach model, the JG transition line\n$T_{JG}(B)$ is shown to have a similar form to a $B$-$T$ line following from\nthe {\\it disorder-free} Lindemann criterion and to decrease with increasing $B\n\\sqrt{\\Gamma}$, in marked contrast to the disorder-free melting line {\\it\ninsensitive to} $B \\sqrt{\\Gamma}$ in such the high field region. This\n$T_{JG}(B)$ line seems to have been recently observed in a.c. susceptibility\nand in-plane resistivity measurements in BSCCO and qualitatively explains a\nfield dependence at lower temperatures of previous BSCCO resistivity data\nshowing the so-called in-plane Lorentz force-free behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2000 12:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In\nthis conjecture, superconducting and antiferromagnetic long-range orders are\ndriven by interlayer coupling. Strictly in two dimensions, the microscopic\nHubbard model has an (resonating valence bond) insulator-to-metal transition at\n$x=x_{c}$ near optimal doping for zero temperature, leading to a quantum\ncritical point, and one of the crossover lines is given by the pseudogap\ntemperature $T^{*}$. We argue that various singular and non-Fermi liquid\nproperties observed near optimal doping are due to the presence of this quantum\ncritical point. In our conjecture, the crossover line $T^{*}$ also practically\ndivides the superconducting region into two, depending on the doping level with\nrespect to $x_{c}$. For $x \\leq x_{c}$ the superconducting state has\nsignificant antiferromagnetic correlations, while for $x > x_{c}$ it has\nvirtually no antiferromagnetic correlations, thus justifying the conventional\nBCS theory based on the noninteracting electrons. Inelastic neutron scattering\nresonance and systematically reduced superfluid density in the superconducting\nstate below $x_{c}$ have their natural explanations in the present scenario.\nThe present approach supports interlayer pair tunneling model where the\nsuperconducting condensation energy comes from the lowering of the c-axis\nkinetic energy in the superconducting state. Comparison of the present scenario\nwith some of the leading theories based on the Hubbard and $t-J$ models is\ngiven.

This method is designed to detect\nshort-duration (< 0.5 s) burst signals of unknown waveform, such as those from\nsupernovae or black hole mergers. If only the bursts' duration and frequency\nband are known, the method is an optimal detection strategy in both Bayesian\nand frequentist senses. It consists of summing the data power over the known\ntime interval and frequency band of the burst. If the detector noise is\nstationary and Gaussian, this sum is distributed as a chi-squared (non-central\nchi-squared) deviate in the absence (presence) of a signal. One can use these\ndistributions to compute frequentist detection thresholds for the measured\npower. We derive the method from Bayesian analyses and show how to compute\nBayesian thresholds.

The\n$SL(2,\\R)$-action in the Hennings construction comes from the natural action on\n$\\cal N$ and in the case of the Frohman-Nicas theory from the Hard-Lefschetz\ndecomposition of the U(1)-moduli spaces given that they are naturally K\\\"ahler.\nThe irreducible components of this TQFT, corresponding to simple\nrepresentations of $SL(2,\\Z)$ and $Sp(2g,\\Z)$, thus yield a large family of\nhomological TQFT's by taking sums and products. We give several examples of\nTQFT's and invariants that appear to fit into this family, such as Milnor and\nReidemeister Torsion, Seiberg-Witten theories, Casson type theories for\nhomology circles \\'a la Donaldson, higher rank gauge theories following Frohman\nand Nicas, and the $\\Z/r$ reductions of Reshetikhin-Turaev theories over the\ncyclotomic integers $\\Z[\\zeta_r]$. We also conjecture that the Hennings TQFT\nfor quantum-${\\mathfrak sl}_2$ is the product of the Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT\nand such a homological TQFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2000 15:30:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2000 16:21:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2001 20:55:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 2002 22:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-03"}

The quasiparticle\nexcitation spectrum is fourfold split compared to the usual BCS spectrum of the\nsymmetric, homogeneous matter. A twofold splitting of the spectrum into\nseparate branches is due to the finite momentum of the condensate, the isospin\nasymmetry, or the finite quasiparticle lifetime. The coupling of the isospin\nsinglet and triplet paired states leads to further twofold splitting of each of\nthese branches. We solve the gap equation numerically in the isospin singlet\nchannel in the case where the pairing in the isospin triplet channel is\nneglected and find nontrivial solutions with finite total momentum of the\npairs. The corresponding phase assumes a periodic spatial structure which\ncarries a isospin density wave at constant total number of particles. The phase\ntransition from the BCS to the inhomogeneous superconducting phase is found to\nbe first order and occurs when the density asymmetry is increased above 0.25.\nThe transition from the inhomogeneous superconducting to the unpaired normal\nstate is second order. The maximal values of the critical total momentum (in\nunits of the Fermi momentum) and the critical density asymmetry at which\ncondensate disappears are $P_c/p_F = 0.3$ and $\\alpha_c = 0.41$.
