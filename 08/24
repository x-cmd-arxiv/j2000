As in extreme\nmass-ratio cataclysmic variables (CVs), superhumps are assumed to result from\nthe presence of the 3:1 orbital resonance in the accretion disc. This causes\nthe disc to become non-axisymmetric and precess. However the mechanism for\nsuperhump luminosity variations in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) must differ\nfrom that in CVs, where it is attributed to a tidally-driven modulation of the\ndisc's viscous dissipation, varying on the beat between the orbital and disc\nprecession period. By contrast in LMXBs, tidal dissipation in the outer\naccretion disc is negligible: the optical emission is overwhelming dominated by\nreprocessing of intercepted central X-rays. Thus a different origin for the\nsuperhump modulation is required. Recent observations and numerical simulations\nindicate that in an extreme mass-ratio system the disc area changes on the\nsuperhump period. We deduce that the superhumps observed in SXTs arise from a\nmodulation of the reprocessed flux by the changing area. Therefore, unlike the\nsituation in CVs, where the superhump amplitude is inclination-independent,\nsuperhumps should be best seen in low-inclination LMXBs, whereas an orbital\nmodulation from the heated face of the secondary star should be more prominent\nat high inclinations. Modulation at the disc precession period (10s of days)\nmay indicate disc asymmetries such as warping.

Step II: Subsequently, supernova\nexplosions occur inside the galaxy and then blow out as a galactic wind (or a\nsuperwind). This wind expands into the intergalactic space and then causes a\nlarge-scale shell with a radius of several hundreds of kpc. Since this radius\nmay be smaller than the typical separation between galaxies, interactions of\nshells may also occur, resulting in the formation of a large-scale gaseous\nslab.

Significant effort has been devoted to packaging the diagnostic\ndevices in minimal space. Close ties are maintained to the rest of the SNS\neffort, to ensure long term compatibility of interfaces and in fact share some\ndesign work and construction. The data acquisition, digital processing, and\ncontrol system interface needs for the BPM, BCM, and LEBT diagnostic are\nsimilar, and we are committed to using an architecture common with the rest of\nthe SNS collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2000 18:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-15"}

Two concrete problems are\nstudied: the circular hydraulic jump and the flow down an inclined plane. For\nthe circular hydraulic jump our method is able to handle an internal eddy and\nseparated flow. Assuming a variable radial velocity profile like in\nKarman-Pohlhausen's method, we obtain a system of two ordinary differential\nequations for stationary states that can smoothly go through the jump where\nprevious studies encountered a singularity. Solutions of the system are in good\nagreement with experiments. For the flow down an inclined plane we take a\nsimilar approach and derive a simple model in which the velocity profile is not\nrestricted to a parabolic or self-similar form. Two types of solutions with\nlarge surface distortions are found: solitary, kink-like propagating fronts,\nobtained when the flow rate is suddenly changed, and stationary jumps,\nobtained, e.g., behind a sluice gate. We then include time-dependence in the\nmodel to study stability of these waves. This allows us to distinguish between\nsub- and supercritical flows by calculating dispersion relations for\nwavelengths of the order of the width of the layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2000 14:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
