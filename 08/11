From accurate\nspectropolarimetry of 7 quasars which show this alignment effect, we find that\nthe polarization is universally confined to the continuum, and not shared by\nthe line emission or 3000A bump. Over the observed region 4000-8000A, the\nspectral indices of polarized flux, P x Flambda, are consistent with uniform\npolarization applied to the light of the big blue bump or with synchrotron\nemission.

These designs are identical to a\nconventional broad-band interferometer (without signal recycling), except for\nnew input and/or output optics. Three designs are analyzed: (i) a\n\"squeezed-input interferometer\" (conceived by Unruh based on earlier work of\nCaves) in which squeezed vacuum with frequency-dependent (FD) squeeze angle is\ninjected into the interferometer's dark port; (ii) a \"variational-output\"\ninterferometer (conceived in a different form by Vyatchanin, Matsko and\nZubova), in which homodyne detection with FD homodyne phase is performed on the\noutput light; and (iii) a \"squeezed-variational interferometer\" with squeezed\ninput and FD-homodyne output. It is shown that the FD squeezed-input light can\nbe produced by sending ordinary squeezed light through two successive\nFabry-Perot filter cavities before injection into the interferometer, and\nFD-homodyne detection can be achieved by sending the output light through two\nfilter cavities before ordinary homodyne detection. With anticipated technology\nand with laser powers comparable to that planned for LIGO-II, these\ninterferometers can beat the amplitude SQL by factors in the range from 3 to 5,\ncorresponding to event rate increases between ~30 and ~100 over the rate for a\nSQL-limited interferometer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2000 06:07:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2001 06:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

First I explain how to choose a time in special\nrelativity. Inclusion of Poincare invariance naturally leads to Dirac's forms\nof relativistic dynamics. Among these, the front form, being the basis for\nlight-cone quantization, is my main focus. I explain a few of its peculiar\nfeatures such as boost and Galilei invariance or separation of relative and\ncenter-of-mass motion. Combining light-cone dynamics and field quantization\nresults in light-cone quantum field theory. As the latter represents a\nfirst-order system, quantization is somewhat nonstandard. I address this issue\nusing Schwinger's quantum action principle, the method of Faddeev and Jackiw,\nand the functional Schroedinger picture. A finite-volume formulation,\ndiscretized light-cone quantization, is analysed in detail. I point out some\nproblems with causality, which are absent in infinite volume. Finally, the\ntriviality of the light-cone vacuum is established. Coming to applications, I\nintroduce the notion of light-cone wave functions as the solutions of the\nlight-cone Schroedinger equation. I discuss some examples, among them\nnonrelativistic Coulomb systems and model field theories in two dimensions.\nVacuum properties (like chiral condensates) are reconstructed from the particle\nspectrum obtained by solving the light-cone Schroedinger equation. In a last\napplication, I make contact with phenomenology by calculating the pion wave\nfunction within the Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model. I am thus able to predict a\nnumber of observables like the pion charge and core radius, the r.m.s.\ntransverse momentum, the pion structure function and the pion distribution\namplitude.

Damage in the form of cracks may be induced on the surface after the\napplication of many pulses of RF. The experiment consists of two circularly\ncylindrical cavities operated in the TE011 mode at a resonant frequency of\n11.424 GHz. Each cavity received 8.5 MW, 1.2 microsecond pulses at 60 Hz\ncorresponding to a calculated temperature rise of 120 K on the copper surface.\nAfter 5.5 x 10^7 pulses, the experiment was stopped and the copper surfaces\nwere examined. Damage is present on the area of the surface where the maximum\nheating occurred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2000 21:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

The energy instability of the 1.5 GeV linac has been a problem\nmaking the beam injection to the damping ring unstable. Because the unstable\nbeam generates also large amount of the radiation, the beam current is limited\nby the KEK radiation safety policy much lower than what we expect. Stabilizing\nthe S-band linac is therefore important not only to improve the beam quality,\nbut also to clear the radiation safety limit to start the multi-bunch\noperation.\n  We have made various modifications to solve the problem on the electron gun,\nmodulator, klystron etc. For the modulator, we have developed a feed-forward\ncontrolled De-Q module. This module compensates the voltage jitter by\ncontrolling the deQ timing with a feed-forward circuit because the amount of\nthe excessive charge up is strongly correlated to the charge up slope that can\nbe measured prior to the deQ timing. The energy stability was examined and was\nimproved by a factor of 3, from 0.6% to 0.2% of itself. Modification for the\nfeed-forward circuit to get more stability was made. The test for the new\ncircuit is in progress. For the long term instability, phase-lock system for\nklystron RF is being installed. In the test operation, it showed a good\nperformance and compensate the phase drift less than 1 deg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2000 10:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
