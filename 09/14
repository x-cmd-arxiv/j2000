The\napplicability of the same scaling to Narrow Line Seyfert 1 is less clear and\nthere may be a systematic shift between the power spectra of NLS1 and S1\ngalaxies of the same mass, leading to underestimation of the black hole mass.\nHowever, both the method based on variability and the method based on spectral\nfitting show that those galaxies have relatively low masses and high luminosity\nto the Eddington luminosity ratio, supporting the view of those objects as\nanalogs of galactic sources in their high/soft or very high state based on the\noverall spectral shape.
