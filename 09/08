We detected radio emission from all 17 galaxies.\nAt a FWHM resolution of ~ 10x4 mas, five galaxies show only an unresolved radio\ncore, ten galaxies show core-jet structures, and two galaxies show twin-jet\nstructures. Comparing these VLBA images with images previously obtained with\nthe NRAO VLA, we find that all detected VLBA jets are well-aligned on parsec\nscales with the VLA jets on kilo parsec scales, and that the jet to counter-jet\nsurface brightness ratios, or the sidedness, decreases systematically with\nincreasing distance along the jet. We attribute the sidedness to the Doppler\nboosting effect and its decline to the deceleration of the jets. We show that a\ndistribution of Lorentz factor centered near Gamma = 5 can reproduce our VLBA\ndetection statistics for core, core-jet and twin-jet sources. We also note that\nthe luminosity per unit length, L_j, of the VLBA jets drops quickly with\ndistance, r, along the jet, approximately as L_j being proportional to\nr^(-2.0). We discuss three different mechanisms to explain this jet fading: (1)\nthe decrease of Doppler boosting due to jet deceleration, (2) synchrotron\nlosses, and (3) expansion losses in constant velocity but adiabatically\nspreading jets. Mechanisms (1) and (2) are inconsistent with the observations,\nwhile mechanism (3) is consistent with the observations provided the magnetic\nfield lines in the jets are aligned perpendicular to the jet axis.

A Markov chain that converges to this\nuniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the\nvertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal `slice' defined by\nthe current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves\nthe uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Variations on such `slice\nsampling' methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can\nbe used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in\nturn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling, and more\nefficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling\nto adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive\nfor routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables\nsimultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the\nmagnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of\nthe density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially allow\nthe sampling to adapt to dependencies between variables by constructing local\nquadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by\nsuppressing random walks. This can be done using `overrelaxed' versions of\nunivariate slice sampling procedures, or by using `reflective' multivariate\nslice sampling methods, which bounce off the edges of the slice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2000 21:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
