The PNe with warm dust emission\nrepresent a homogeneous population, which is presumably young and minimally\naffected by a possible dependence of PN lifetime on progenitor mass. The sample\nin paper I thus allows testing the predictions of single star evolution,\nthrough a comparison with synthetic distributions and under the assumption that\ntip-of-the-AGB and PN statistics are similar. We construct a schematic model\nfor AGB evolution (adapted from Groenewegen & de Jong 1993), whose\nfree-parameters are calibrated with the luminosity function (LF) of C stars in\nthe LMC, the initial-final mass relation, and the range of PN compositions. The\nobserved metallicity gradient and distribution of star forming regions with\ngalactocentric radius (Bronfman et al. 2000) allow us to synthesise the\ngalactic disk PN progenitor population. We find the fraction of O-rich PNe,\nf(O), is a tight constraint on AGB parameters. For our best model, a minimum PN\nprogenitor mass Mmin=1Msun predicts that about 50% of all young PNe should be\nO-rich, compared to an observed fraction of 22%; thus Mmin=1.2Msun, at a 2sigma\nconfidence level. By contrast, current AGB models for single stars can account\nneither for the continuous range of N enrichment (Leisy & Dennefeld 1996), nor\nfor the observation that the majority of very C-rich PNe have Peimbert type I\n(paper I). f(O) is thus an observable much easier to model. The decrease in\nf(O) with galactocentric radius, as reported in paper I, is a strong property\nof the synthetic distribution, independent of Mmin. This trend reflects the\nsensitivity of the surface temperature of AGB stars and of the core mass at the\nfirst thermal pulse to the galactic metallicity gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2000 21:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The analysis shows that because a signal has some time extent\n(i.e. after a signal is initiated one must waitat least one period for the\nfrequency and amplitude information to be determined), an electric dipole can\nbe used to transmit a signal backward in time, but not before the same signal\nwas initiated, thereby prohibiting a user from changing the signal that was\ntransmitted. The result is also shown to apply to the superluminal near-field\ngravitational fields generated by an oscillating mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2000 10:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We consider two\nobservers who initially assign identical mixed-state density operators to a\ntwo-state quantum system. The question we address is to what extent one\nobserver can, by measurement, increase the purity of his density operator\nwithout affecting the purity of the other observer's. If there were no\nrestrictions on the first observer's measurements, then he could carry this out\ntrivially by measuring the initial density operator's eigenbasis. If, however,\nthe allowed measurements are those of finite strength---i.e., those\nmeasurements strictly within the interior of the convex set of all\nmeasurements---then the issue becomes significantly more complex. We find that\nfor a large class of such measurements the first observer's purity increases\nthe most precisely when there is some loss of purity for the second observer.\nMore generally the tradeoff between the two purities, when it exists, forms a\nmonotonic relation. This tradeoff has potential application to quantum state\ncontrol and feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2000 16:08:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
