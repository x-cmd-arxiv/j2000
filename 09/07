The most remarkable variability\nevent occurred on 1998 June 18, when the degree of linear polarization\ndecreased by more than a factor 2 in one day in all bands, while the PA rotated\nby 90 deg. This is consistent with the presence of two emission components, of\ndifferent polarization degree and position angle. Intranight variability of P\nand PA can be interpreted with small amplitude physical or geometrical changes\nwithin the jet. Measurements of the circular polarization over time intervals\nof days set upper limits of 0.2%. Simultaneous photometry taken with the Turin\nPhotopolarimeter and with a CCD camera at Cordoba Astronomical Observatory did\nnot show light variations correlated with those of the linearly polarized flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2000 15:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Such\nazimuthal anisotropy is studied qualitatively in a parton model for heavy-ion\ncollisions at the RHIC energies. The coefficient $v_2(p_T)$ of the elliptic\nanisotropy at large $p_T$ is found to be very sensitive to parton energy loss.\nIt decreases slowly with $p_T$ contrary to its low $p_T$ behavior where $v_2$\nincreases very rapidly with $p_T$. The turning point signals the onset of\ncontributions of hard processes and the magnitude of parton energy loss. The\ncentrality dependence of $v_2(p_T)$ is shown to be sensitive to both size and\ndensity dependence of the parton energy loss and the later can also be studied\nvia variation of the colliding energy. The anisotropy coefficient\n$v_2/\\epsilon$ normalized by the spatial ellipticity $\\epsilon$ is found to\ndecrease significantly toward semi-peripheral collisions, differing from the\nhydrodynamic results for low $p_T$ hadrons. Constrained by the existing WA98\nexperimental data at the SPS energy on parton energy loss, both hadron spectra\nsuppression and azimuthal anisotropy at high $p_T$ are predicted to vanish for\n$b>$7-8 fm in $Au+Au$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$130-200 GeV when the hadron\nrapidity density per unit area of the initial overlapped region is less than\nwhat is achieved in the central $Pb+Pb$ collisions at the SPS energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2000 02:36:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2000 01:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

Using the exact three-body\nwavefunction in the region where two of the three particles remain close, a\nrevised description of these local momenta, is attained which predicts that a\nquantum-mechanical impulse may develop in the reaction zone, causing\nlike-sign-charged particles to decrease their radial separation and\nopposite-sign-charged particles to increase their radial separation. The\nconsequences of these predictions are investigated through both quantum and\nsemi-classical techniques where the total energy of a two-body continuum\nCoulomb system in the presence of a third, mutually interacting body are\nanalyzed. Numerical calculations confirm that while ignoring these local\neffects for light-ion-atom processes, may be appropriate, three-body effects\nmay dominate in the reaction zone for heavy-ion-atom processes. This hypothesis\nis investigated and it is shown that a real-valued, position-dependent phase is\nadded to the wavefunction. Further analysis shows that one may detect\nasymptotic variations in the scattering amplitudes for massive systems at\nnear-threshold energies. These results provide convincing theoretical and\nphysical evidence for a formal three-body gauge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2000 22:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2000 15:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
