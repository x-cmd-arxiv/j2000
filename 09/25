Although its definition is purely topological (inspired by the bridge\nnumber of knots), p(T) reflects the geometric properties of T.\n  Specifically, if T is polytopal or shellable then p(T) is `small' in the\nsense that we obtain a linear upper bound for p(T) in the number n=n(T) of\ntetrahedra of T.\n  Conversely, if p(T) is `small' then T is `almost' polytopal, since we show\nhow to transform T into a polytopal triangulation by O((p(T))^2) local\nsubdivisions. The minimal number of local subdivisions needed to transform T\ninto a polytopal triangulation is at least $\\frac{p(T)}{3n}-n-2$.\n  Using our previous results [math.GT/0007032], we obtain a general upper bound\nfor p(T) exponential in n^2. We prove here by explicit constructions that there\nis no general subexponential upper bound for p(T) in n. Thus, we obtain\ntriangulations that are `very far' from being polytopal.\n  Our results yield a recognition algorithm for S^3 that is conceptually\nsimpler, though somewhat slower, as the famous Rubinstein-Thompson algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2000 10:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2001 14:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Dec 2002 13:14:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 17 Aug 2004 14:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
