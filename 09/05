In the\nfirst observation, approximately 20 days after the outburst peak, the X-ray\nlight curve showed Type II bursts at a rate of 43 per hour. Nine days later,\nduring the second BeppoSAX pointing, only 5 Type II bursts were detected at the\nbeginning of the observation. During the third pointing no X-ray bursts were\ndetected and in the fourth and final observation the RB was not detected at\nall. Persistent emission from the RB was detected up to 10 keV during the first\nthree pointings. The spectra of the persistent and bursting emissions below 10\nkeV were best fit with a model consisting of two blackbodies. An additional\ncomponent (a power law) was needed to describe the 1-100 keV bursting spectrum\nwhen the persistent emission was subtracted. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst detection of the RB beyond 20 keV. We discuss the evolution of the\nspectral parameters for the bursting and persistent emission during the\noutburst decay. The light curve, after the second BeppoSAX pointing, showed a\nsteepening of the previous decay trend, and a sharper decay rate leading to\nquiescence was observed with BeppoSAX in the two subsequent observations. We\ninterpret this behaviour as caused by the onset of the propeller effect.\nFinally, we infer a neutron star magnetic field B ~ 4 10^8 Gauss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2000 16:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We argue that the most\npromising way to test this hypothesis is to look for possible imprints of\nmagnetic fields on the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation (CMBR). With this purpose in mind, we provide a\nreview of the most relevant effects of magnetic fields on the CMBR. A long\nchapter of this review is dedicated to particle physics inspired models which\npredict the generation of magnetic fields during the early Universe evolution.\nAlthough it is still unclear if any of these models can really explain the\norigin of galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields, we show that interesting\neffects may arise anyhow. Among these effects, we discuss the consequences of\nstrong magnetic fields on the big-bang nucleosynthesis, on the masses and\ncouplings of the matter constituents, on the electroweak phase transition, and\non the baryon and lepton number violating sphaleron processes. Several\nintriguing common aspects, and possible interplay, of magnetogenesis and\nbaryogenesis are also dicussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2000 13:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2001 11:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-07-09"}

The basic quantities considered are\nthe Wigner-Smith and single-mode delay times, plus the time-dependent power\nspectrum of a reflected pulse. The long-time dynamics is dominated by resonant\ntransmission over length scales much larger than the localization length. The\ncorresponding distribution of the Wigner-Smith delay times is the Laguerre\nensemble of random-matrix theory. In the power spectrum the resonances show up\nas a 1/t^2 tail after N^2 scattering times. In the distribution of single-mode\ndelay times the resonances introduce a dynamic coherent backscattering effect,\nthat provides a way to distinguish localization from absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2000 15:50:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2000 14:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-08"}
