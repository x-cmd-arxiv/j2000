The latest evolutionary equations are adopted, which extend the\nclassical alpha theory to time-dependent thin discs with non-linear warps. We\nalso develop accurate, analytical expressions for the tidal torque and the\nradiation torque, including self-shadowing.\n  We investigate the possible non-linear dynamics of the system within the\nframework of bifurcation theory. First, we re-examine the stability of an\ninitially flat disc to the Pringle instability. Then we compute directly the\nbranches of non-linear solutions representing steadily precessing discs.\nFinally, we determine the stability of the non-linear solutions. Each problem\ninvolves only ordinary differential equations, allowing a rapid, accurate and\nwell resolved solution.\n  We find that radiation-driven warping is probably not a common occurrence in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries. We also find that stable, steadily precessing discs\nexist for a narrow range of parameters close to the stability limit. This could\nexplain why so few systems show clear, repeatable `super-orbital' variations.\nThe best examples of such systems, Her X-1, SS 433 and LMC X-4, all lie close\nto the stability limit for a reasonable choice of parameters. Systems far from\nthe stability limit, including Cyg X-2, Cen X-3 and SMC X-1, probably\nexperience quasi-periodic or chaotic variability as first noticed by Wijers &\nPringle.
