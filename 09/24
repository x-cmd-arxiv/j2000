AC118 is a bimodal cluster, as evidenced both by our\nnear-infrared images of lensed galaxies, by public X-ray Rosat images and by\nthe spatial distribution of bright galaxies. Taking advantage of the extension\nand depth of our data, which sample an almost unexplored region in the depth\nvs. observed area diagram, we derive the luminosity function (LF), down to the\ndwarf regime (M*+5), computed in several cluster portions. The overall LF,\ncomputed on a 2.66 Mpc2 areas (H_0=50 km/s/Mpc), has an intermediate slope\n(alpha=-1.2). However, the LF parameters depend on the surveyed cluster region:\nthe central concentration has 2.6^{+5.1}_{-1.7} times more bright galaxies and\n5.3^{+7.2}_{-2.3} times less dwarfs per typical galaxy than the outer region,\nwhich includes galaxies at an average projected distance of ~580 kpc (errors\nare quoted at the 99.9 % confidence level). The LF in the secondary AC118 clump\nis intermediate between the central and outer one. In other words, the\nnear-infrared AC118 LF steepens going from high to low density regions. At an\naverage clustercentric distance of ~580 kpc, the AC118 LF is statistically\nindistinguishable from the LF of field galaxies at similar redshift, thus\nsuggesting that the hostile cluster environment plays a minor role in shaping\nthe LF at large clustercentric distances, while it strongly affects the LF at\nhigher galaxy density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Sep 2000 09:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
