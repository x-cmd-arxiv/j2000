This effect depends sensitively on the neutron to proton ratio in\nthe fireball, becoming more dramatic with increasing neutron excess. Simple\nphysical arguments and transport calculations indicate that the dispersion in\nLorentz factor of the protons can be of order the final mean Lorentz factor of\nthe fireball. We show how plasma instabilities could play an important role in\nthe evolution of the fireball and how they might ultimately govern the\ndevelopment of such a velocity dispersion in the proton component. The role of\nthese instabilities in setting/diminishing a proton Lorentz factor dispersion\nrepresents a new and potentially important venue for the study of plasma\ninstabilities. Significant dispersion in the proton velocities translates into\nfewer protons attaining the highest Lorentz factors. This is tantamount to a\nreduction in the total energy required to attain a given Lorentz factor for the\nhighest energy protons.

To make a breakthrough in testing these massive\nequations we designed several novel algorithms for generating Greechie diagrams\nwith an arbitrary number of blocks and atoms (currently testing with up to 50)\nand for automated checking of equations on them. A way of obtaining complex\ninfinite dimensional Hilbert space from the Hilbert lattice equipped with\nseveral additional conditions and without invoking the notion of state is\npresented. Possible repercussions of the results to quantum computing problems\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Sep 2000 18:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2000 23:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Jan 2001 19:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
