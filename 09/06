The luminosity decline rate, Delta m_B(15) = 1.31 +/-\n0.08, is close to average for a SN Ia. The best estimate of the galactic\nextinction is A_B=0.30 +/- 0.05, and there is evidence that reddening within\nthe parent galaxy is negligible. Detailed comparison of the light and colour\ncurves of various `normal' SNe Ia shows that the assumption that multicolour\nlight curves can be described simply as a one-parameter family is not perfect.\nTogether with problems in the calibration of the templates, this may explain\nthe discrepancies in the distance modulus derived adopting different\ncalibrations of the absolute magnitude vs. light curve shape relations.

The fermion present\nin this superfield is the sterile neutrino, which combines with one linear\ncombination of $\\nu_e-\\nu_{\\mu}-\\nu_{\\tau}$ to form a Dirac pair whose mass\naccounts for the LSND anomaly. Its small mass can be ascribed to a volume\nsuppression factor associated with extra compact dimensions. On the other hand\nthe sterile neutrino scalar partner can trigger the spontaneous violation of\nR-parity, thereby inducing the necessary mass splittings to fit also the solar\nand atmospheric neutrino data. Thus the model can explain all neutrino\noscillation data. It leads to four predictions for the neutrino oscillation\nparameters and implies that the atmospheric neutrino problem must include at\nleast some $\\nu_{\\mu} \\to \\nu_s$ oscillations, which will be testable in the\nnear future.

Their net effects differ depending on\nthe energy region. At energies above the Coulomb barrier, the former effect\ndominates over the latter and cross sections for complete fusion are hindered\ncompared with the no coupling case.

The phase difference between the two antenna signals is monitored with\nan oscilloscope as the distance between the antennas is increased. Analysis of\nthe phase vs distance curve indicates that superluminal transverse electric\nfield waves (phase and group) are generated approximately one-quarter\nwavelength outside the source and propagate toward and away from the source.\nUpon creation, the transverse waves travel with infinite speed. The outgoing\ntransverse waves reduce to the speed of light after they propagate about one\nwavelength away from the source.
