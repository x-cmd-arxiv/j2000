These\nsimulations examined the effects of different types of cluster mergers (with\n16:1 and 4:1 mass ratios) on the evolution of cluster cooling flows (mass\naccretion rates of 100 and 400 M/year. The 2-dimensional simulations were\nperformed with a Hydro/N-body code on a uniform grid with a resolution of 20\nkpc.\n  We find that the ram-pressure of the infalling gas is crucial in determining\nthe fate of the cooling flow as disruption occurs when a substantial amount of\nsubcluster gas reaches the primary's core. In such cases, the subcluster gas\ncan increase the central cooling time by displacing the high-density cooling\ngas and by heating it via shocks and turbulent gas motions. Moreover, the fate\nof a merging cooling flow is also dependent on its initial cooling time. In\ncases where the initial cooling time is very small then, even if the flow is\ndisrupted, the central cooling time will remain less than a Hubble time and the\nflow will likely re-establish itself. This has an important observational\nconsequence because such clusters will be classified as cooling flows even\nthough they have experienced a significant merger. In addition, there is a time\ndelay (1-2 Gyrs) between core-crossing and the point at which the central\ncooling time of a disrupted flow becomes of order a Hubble time (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2000 19:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The 1117-day SK data for recoil electron spectrum are also\nexamined for signals of VEP oscillations. For these fits, we consider\nvariations of the Standard Solar Model by allowing the absolute normalizations\nof the 8B and hep neutrinos to vary. Here the fits are quite good but the best\nfit values of the parameters are rather different from those from the total\nrates fits.

It follows, in fact, that such sentences must also hold in all\nforcing extensions of V. In modal terms, therefore, the Maximality Principle is\nexpressed by the scheme (diamond box phi) implies (box phi), and is equivalent\nto the modal theory S5. In this article, I prove that the Maximality Principle\nis relatively consistent with ZFC. A boldface version of the Maximality\nPrinciple, obtained by allowing real parameters to appear in phi, is\nequiconsistent with the scheme asserting that V_delta is an elementary\nsubstructure of V for an inaccessible cardinal delta, which in turn is\nequiconsistent with the scheme asserting that ORD is Mahlo. The strongest\nprinciple along these lines is the Necessary Maximality Principle, which\nasserts that the boldface MP holds in V and all forcing extensions.

In general, injected particle distributions with\nsystematic charge nonuniformities are not equilibria of the focusing channel\nand launch a broad spectrum of collective modes. These modes can phase-mix and\nhave nonlinear wave-wave interactions which, at high space-charge intensities,\nresults in a relaxation to a more thermal-like distribution characterized by a\nuniform density profile. This thermalization can transfer self-field energy\nfrom the initial space-charge nonuniformity to the local particle temperature,\nthereby increasing beam phase space area (emittance growth). In this paper, we\nemploy a simple kinetic model of a continuous focusing channel and build on\nprevious work that applied system energy and charge conservation quantify\nemittance growth associated with the collective thermalization of an initial\nazimuthally symmetric, rms matched beam with a radial density profile that is\nhollowed or peaked.
