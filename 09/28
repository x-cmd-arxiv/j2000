We statistically estimate the galaxy evolution\nhistory from these data. We find that an order of magnitude increase of the\nfar-infrared (FIR) luminosity at redshift z = 0.5 - 1.0 is necessary to\nreproduce the very high CIRB intensity at 140 um reported by Hauser et al.\n(1998). z \\sim 0.75 and decreases to, even at most, a factor of 10 toward z\n\\sim 5, though many variants are allowed within these constraints. This\nevolution history also satisfies the constraints from the galaxy number counts\nobtained by IRAS, ISO and, roughly, SCUBA. The rapid evolution of the comoving\nIR luminosity density required from the CIRB well reproduces the very steep\nslope of galaxy number counts obtained by ISO. We also estimate the cosmic star\nformation history (SFH) from the obtained FIR luminosity density, considering\nthe effect of the metal enrichment in galaxies. The derived SFH increases\nsteeply with redshift in 0 < z < 0.75, and becomes flat or even declines at z >\n0.75.

The model described here is based on results from Quantum Field\nMechanics, according to which all fundamental particles and interactions\noriginate from the interaction of two pre-space/pre-time protofields. In\ncontrast with the Standard Model, (virtual) interaction-particles are absent in\nthe description of any of the four fundamental interactions. Electrons perform\na single quantum beat process while mesons and baryons have, respectively, two\nand three bound quantum beat processes. Quantum Field Mechanics suggests that\nthe charge of an electron and positron can be identified with the two possible\nphases of a quantum beat process as observed in the electromagnetic protofield.\nThis report assumes that short-range binding interaction between quantum beat\nprocesses has a masking effect on the externally observable charge of hadrons.\nUsing this assumption, the internal structure of particles is derived from\ntheir known particle charges and relative masses. The particle structures are\nused to obtain the so-called charge-quantum phase law. The fractional charge of\nquantum beat processes inside a particle is deduced by rewriting the\ncharge-quantum phase law in terms of a linear combination of charge\ncontributions of individual constituent quantum beat processes. Strangeness and\nisospin are mathematically defined in terms of the quantum beat phases of sets\nof particles of the same type. Application of conservation laws to particle\nprocesses leads to relations between quantum phase, strangeness and isospin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2000 18:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2009 15:44:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 May 2009 16:17:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 21:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-10-20"}

They\nare the old idea of Chew about bootstrapping, Nottale's scale relativity, and\nenlargement of the conventional time-space by inclusion of noncommutative\nClifford manifolds where all p-branes are treated on equal footing. The latter\nallows one to write a master action functional. The resulting functional\nequation is simplified and applied to the p-loop oscillator. Its solution\nrepresents a generalization of the conventional quantum point oscillator. In\naddition, it exhibits some novel features: an emergence of two explicit scales\ndelineating the asymptotic regimes (Planck scale region and a smooth region of\na quantum point oscillator). In the most interesting Planck scale regime, the\nsolution recovers in an elementary fashion some basic relations of string\ntheory (including string tension quantization and string uncertainty relation).\nIt is shown that the degeneracy of the $first$ collective excited state of the\np-loop oscillator yields not only the well-known Bekenstein-Hawking\narea-entropy linear relation but also the logarithmic corrections therein. In\naddition we obtain for any number of dimensions the Hawking temperature, the\nSchwarschild radius, and the inequalities governing the area of a black hole\nformed in a fusion of two black holes.
