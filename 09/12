In this context, the issue of whether one-loop RG equations can be\ntrusted in predicting symmetry restoration has recently been the subject of\nmuch debate. Here we advocate a more pragmatic point of view and expand the\ndefinition of symmetry restoration to encompass all situations where the\nphysical properties have only a weak dependence upon an anisotropy in the bare\ncouplings. Moreover we concentrate on universal properties, and so take a\nscaling limit where the physics is well described by a field theory. In this\ncontext, we find a large variety of models that exhibit, for all practical\npurposes, symmetry restoration: even if symmetry is not restored in a strict\nsense, physical properties are surprisingly insensitive to the remaining\nanisotropy.\n  Although we have adopted an expanded notion of symmetry restoration, we\nnonetheless emphasize that the scaling limit also has implications for symmetry\nrestoration as a renormalization group induced phenomenon. In all the models we\nconsidered, the scaling limit turns out to only permit bare couplings which are\nnearly isotropic and small. Then the one-loop beta-function should contain all\nthe physics and higher loop orders can be neglected. We suggest that this\nfeature generalizes to more complex models. We exhibit a large class of\ntheories with current-current perturbations (of which the SO(8) model of\ninterest in two-leg Hubbard ladders/armchair carbon nanotubes is one) where the\none-loop beta-functions indicates symmetry restoration and so argue that these\nresults can be trusted within the scaling limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2000 01:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

However, general relativity has not yet yielded to a\nsuccessful quantised theory. There is a widespread belief that the two thories\nare incompatible at some deep level. The question is: where? Here, I show that\nthe conceptual foundations of the theory of general relativity and quantum\nmechanics are so rich that they suggest concrete modifications into each other\nin the interface region. Specifically, I consider quantum states that have no\nclassical counterpart and show that such states must carry an inherent\nviolation of the principle of equivalence. On the other hand, I show that when\ngravitational effects are incorporated into the quantum measurement process one\nmust induce a gravitationally induced modification to the de Broglie's\nwave-particle duality.

The two methods of reducing the long-range\nwakefields are detuning and damping. Detuning reduces the wakefields rapidly as\nthe dipole modes de-cohere but, with a finite number of modes, the wakefield\nwill grow again as the modes re-cohere. In contrast, damping suppresses the\nwakefields at a longer distance. There are two principal damping schemes:\nsynchronous damping using HOM manifolds such as that used in the RDDS1\nstructure and local damping similar to that used in the CLIC structure. In a\nlocally damped scheme, one can obtain almost any Q value, however, the damping\ncan have significant effects on the accelerating mode.
