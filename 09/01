Our analysis shows that the frequency of this mode is a\nfunction of the mass of the central object and it also depends on the inner and\nouter radii of the disk which in turn are related to the rotation period of the\nbinary system. We derive an analytical formula for the frequency of the normal\ndisk mode and show that these frequencies can be related to the persistent\nlower QPO frequencies observed in the NS and BH sources.

Our results show that X-ray data\nare more powerful than optical ones, allowing smaller regions in the parameter\nspace. We find that the clustering properties of clusters are almost\nindependent of the matter density parameter and of the presence of a\ncosmological constant, while they appear to be strongly dependent on the shape\nparameter. Using the X-ray data only, we obtain Gamma~0.1 and 0.4<sigma_8<1.1\nfor the Einstein-de Sitter model, while 0.14<Gamma<0.22 and 0.6<sigma_8<1.3 for\nopen and flat models with Omega_0m=0.3. Finally, we use our model to make\npredictions on the correlation length of galaxy clusters expected in future\nsurveys. In particular, we show the results for an optical catalogue with\ncharacteristics similar to the EIS project and for a very deep X-ray catalogue\nwith the characteristics of the XMM/LSS survey. We find that clusters at high\nredshifts are expected to have larger a correlation length than local ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2000 08:37:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jun 2001 19:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

This formulation allows a straightforward extension of the monolayer\ncase to thin films with many layers and for arbitrary spin and moreover\nprovides a practicable procedure for numerical computation. The model\nHamiltonian includes a Heisenberg term, an external magnetic field, a\nsecond-order uniaxial single-ion anisotropy, and the magnetic dipole-dipole\ncoupling. We utilize the Tyablikov (RPA) decoupling for the exchange\ninteraction terms and the Anderson-Callen decoupling for the anisotropy terms.\nThe dipole coupling is treated in the mean-field approximation, a procedure\nwhich we demonstrate to be a sufficiently good approximation for realistic\ncoupling strengths. We apply the new method to monolayers with spin $S\\geq 1$\nand to multilayer systems with S=1.

We study the behavior of two neural oscillators, each\nindividually governed by saddle-node dynamics, with reciprocal excitatory\nsynaptic connections. In the deterministic circuit, the synaptic current\namplitude acts as a control parameter to move the circuit from a mono-stable\nregime through a bifurcation into a bistable regime. In this regime stable\nsustained anti-phase oscillations in both neurons coexist with a stable rest\nstate. We introduce a small amount of random current into both neurons to model\npossible randomly arriving synaptic inputs. We find that such random noise\ndelays the onset of bistability, even though in decoupled neurons noise tends\nto advance bifurcations and the circuit has only excitatory coupling. We show\nthat the delay is dependent on the level of noise and suggest that a curious\nstochastic ``anti-resonance'' is present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2000 12:17:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
