The asymptotic\nfalloff is always a power law though generally different in the deep time-like\nand space-like regions. The contributions of quasiparticle poles and Landau\nbranch cuts are computed. The most difficult calculation is the contribution of\nthe branch cut in the transverse propagator D^{ij}(t,r). For QED this produces\na leading behavior of order T/r in both the time-like and space-like regions.\nThe inclusion of a magnetic mass so as to describe QCD makes the leading\nbehavior 1/(Tr^{3}), thus improving the infrared convergence. The asymptotic\nspace-like behavior of all contributions (longitudinal and transverse, poles\nand cuts) is confirmed by also computing in the Euclidean formalism and\nanalytically continuing. The results are compared will those for free gauge\nbosons at finite temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2000 17:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Their implications for single systems like the hydrogen atom or the\nharmonic oscillator have been addressed. In this paper we investigate the\nconsequences of some of these algebras for macroscopic systems. The key point\nof our analysis lies in the fact that the modification of the Heisenberg\nuncertainty relations present in these theories changes the volume of the\nelementary cell in the hamiltonian phase space and so the measure needed to\ncompute partition functions.\n  The thermodynamics of a non interacting gas are studied for two members of\nthe Kempf-Mangano-Mann (K.M.M.) deformations. It is shown that the theory which\nexhibits a minimal uncertainty in length predicts a new behavior at high\ntemperature while the one with a minimal uncertainty in momentum displays\nunusual features for huge volumes. In the second model negative pressures are\nobtained and mixing two different gases does not necessarily increase the\nentropy . This suggests a possible violation of the second law of\nthermodynamics. Potential consequences of these models in the evolution of the\nearly universe are briefly discussed.\n  Constructing the Einstein model of a solid for the q deformed oscillator, we\nfind that the subset of eigenstates whose energies are bounded from above leads\nto a divergent partition function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2000 10:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 May 2001 09:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Above a critical inter-qubit coupling strength,\nquantum chaos sets in, leading to quantum ergodicity of eigenstates in an\nisolated quantum computer. The onset of chaos results in the interaction\ninduced dynamical thermalization and the occupation numbers well described by\nthe Fermi-Dirac distribution. This thermalization destroys the noninteracting\nqubit structure and sets serious requirements for the quantum computer\noperability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2000 12:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

For large N and near the classical boundary at\nthe Fermi energy the density displays increasing fluctuations. A simple scaling\nof these tails of the density distribution with respect to N is established.\nThe Fourier transform of the density distribution is calculated exactly. It\ndisplays a small but characteristic hump near 2 k_F with k_F being a properly\ndefined Fermi wave number. This is due to Friedel oscillations which are\nidentified and discussed. These quantum effects are missing in the\nsemi-classical approximation. Momentum distributions are also evaluated and\ndiscussed. As an example of a time-dependent one-particle problem we calculate\nexactly the evolution of the particle density when the trap is suddenly\nswitched off and find a simple scaling behaviour in agreement with recent\ngeneral results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2000 12:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The general scenario is that a bipartite measurement is given from\na set of possibilities and the goal is to find a classical scheme that\nreproduces exactly the correlations that arise when an actual quantum system is\nmeasured. Previous results have shown that, using local hidden variables, a\nfinite amount of communication suffices to simulate the correlations for a Bell\nstate. We extend this in a number of ways. First, we show that, when the\ncommunication is merely required to be finite {\\em on average}, Bell states can\nbe simulated {\\em without} any local hidden variables. More generally, we show\nthat arbitrary positive operator valued measurements on systems of $n$ Bell\nstates can be simulated with $O(n 2^n)$ bits of communication on average\n(again, without local hidden variables). On the other hand, when the\ncommunication is required to be {\\em absolutely bounded}, we show that a finite\nnumber of bits of local hidden variables is insufficent to simulate a Bell\nstate. This latter result is based on an analysis of the non-deterministic\ncommunication complexity of the NOT-EQUAL function, which is constant in the\nquantum model and logarithmic in the classical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2000 14:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
