On the few occasions that it has been detected its\nintrinsic width has been thought to be narrow (FWHM < 10,000 km/s) with an\nequivalent width (EW) of a few tens of eV.This was consistent with the general\ntrend that as one goes from low to high luminosity AGNs the Fe-K line goes from\nbeing strong (EW ~200-300 eV) and broad (FWHM ~ 100,000 km/s) to being weak and\nnarrow, or absent altogether. Here we present the results of new ASCA and RXTE\nobservations, together with archival ASCA data, and show for the first time\nthat the Fe-K line in 3C 273 is as broad as that seen in Seyfert 1. The line is\nresolved in two of the observations, with a mean Gaussian width of 0.8 +/- 0.3\nkeV, or FWHM of 0.3 +/- 0.1c. The smallest and largest EW measured is 43 +/- 34\neV, and 133 (+52,-53) eV respectively (quasar frame). The Compton-reflection\ncontinuum is less than 10% of that expected from a centrally illuminated\nsemi-infinite, face-on, Compton-thick disk, confirming previous studies that\nCompton reflection is negligible in 3C 273. The largest values of the Fe-K line\nEW are under-predicted if the line originates in the disk, unless a time lag\nlonger than several days between line and continuum and/or an over-abundance of\nFe is invoked. We cannot unambiguously constrain the disk inclination angle.\nAbout 60 deg is preferred for a cold disk, while a face-on disk is allowed if\nthe ionization state of Fe is H-like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2000 11:35:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The concomitant\nrelations generalize their Lorentzian prototypes through the presence of a\nsingle characteristic parameter, ~$g$, so that the explicated\nParticle-Antiparticle Asymmetry, as well as the search for possible distinction\nbetween the pseudo-Euclidean Light Geometry and the Finsler-relativistic\nNeutrino Geometry, can well be traced in terms of this parameter. At any fixed\nrest-mass value $m$ and $g\\ne0$, the dependences of energy on three-dimensional\nmomentum prove to be of different forms, as given by the respective functions\n$E^{(+)}(g;m;|{\\bf P}|)$ and $E^{(-)}(g;m;|{\\bf P}|)$, for particles and\nantiparticles. This splitting of the mass-shell, as well as various entailed\nFinslerian approximations with respect to $g$, can naturally be proposed for\nexperimental study in order to obtain estimations on $g$. Since neutrinos and\nantineutrinos are uncomposed neat particles, measuring the difference between\ntheir velocities seems to be the best way for testing implied Finslerian\ncorrections to conventional Lorentzian quantities. Accelerators which can\nproduce neutrinos and antineutrinos are ideal instruments to gain this aim. The\nknown measurements led to the conclusion that the difference $<0.7\\cdot\n10^{-4}~(95%~CL)$, while announced future long baseline neutrino experiments\nprobably raise the sensitivity to approach the high level of $\\sim 10^{-9}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2000 03:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
