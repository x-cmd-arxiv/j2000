The x-ray observations\nwere performed with ASCA. The ASCA results were found to be consistent with\nreanalysed data from two earlier ROSAT observations. The combined ASCA and\nROSAT data reveal an x-ray spectrum that is best fit by a broken power law with\nabsorber model. The break in the x-ray spectrum is interpreted, to be the\nemerging importance of inverse Compton (IC) emission which dominates the ASCA\nspectrum. The faint optical state reported for these observations\n(m_V=18.3+/-0.25) is incompatible with the high synchrotron flux previously\ndetected by ROSAT. The IC emission detected by both ROSAT and ASCA was not\nsignificantly affected by the large change in the synchrotron component. MgII\nemission was detected with an equivalent width (EW) significantly different\nfrom previously reported values. Absorption at a level of in excess of the\nGalactic value was detected, indicating the possible presence of a foreground\nabsorber. A gravitational microlensing scenario cannot therefore be ruled out\nfor this blazar.

General\nrelativity specifies which geodesic path a free particle will follow, but\ngeometrodynamics has no mechanism for generating a reaction force for deviation\nfrom geodesic motion. We discuss a different approach involving the\nelectromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) of the quantum vacuum. It has been found\nthat certain asymmetries arise in the ZPF as perceived from an accelerating\nreference frame. In such a frame the Poynting vector and momentum flux of the\nZPF become non-zero. Scattering of this quantum radiation by the quarks and\nelectrons in matter can result in an acceleration-dependent reaction force.\nBoth the ordinary and the relativistic forms of Newton's second law, the\nequation of motion, can be derived from the electrodynamics of such\nZPF-particle interactions. Conjectural arguments are given why this interaction\nshould take place in a resonance at the Compton frequency, and how this could\nsimultaneously provide a physical basis for the de Broglie wavelength of a\nmoving particle. This affords a suggestive perspective on a deep connection\nbetween electrodynamics, the origin of inertia and the quantum wave nature of\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2000 19:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-27"}

The local-field correction factor to the external\n(radiation and absorption) power loss of the molecule is found to be\n$|3\\epsilon(\\omega)/[3\\epsilon(\\omega)+1]|^2$, with $\\epsilon(\\omega)$ being\nthe dielectric function of the sphere. However, local-field corrections to the\ntotal decay rate (power loss) of the molecule are found to be much more\ncomplex, including those to the decay rate in the infinite cavity medium, as\nderived very recently by Scheel et al. [Rev. A 60, 4094 (1999)], and similiar\ncorrections to the cavity-induced decay rate. The results obtained can be cast\ninto model-independent forms. This suggests the general results for the\nlocal-field corrections to the decay rate and to the external power loss of a\nmolecule in an absorbing cavity valid for molecule positions away from the\ncavity walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2000 13:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
