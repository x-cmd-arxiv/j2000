The resulting\nexpression is similar to the canonical expression = t_{ff}^2/t_{ni} ~ 10 t_{ni}\n(where t_{ff} is the free-fall time and t_{ni} is the neutral-ion collision\ntime), except that it is multiplied by a numerical factor C(\\mu_{c0}), where\n\\mu_{c0} is the initial central mass-to-flux ratio normalized to the critical\nvalue for gravitational collapse. C(\\mu_{c0}) is typically ~ 1 in highly\nsubcritical clouds (\\mu_{c0} << 1), although certain conditions allow\nC(\\mu_{c0}) >> 1. For clouds that are not highly subcritical, C(\\mu_{c0}) can\nbe much less than unity, with C(\\mu_{c0}) --> 0 for \\mu_{c0} --> 1,\nsignificantly reducing the time required to form a supercritical core. This,\nalong with recent observations of clouds with mass-to-flux ratios close to the\ncritical value, may reconcile the results of ambipolar diffusion models with\nstatistical analyses of cores and YSO's which suggest an evolutionary timescale\n\\~ 1 Myr for objects of mean density ~ 10^4 cm^{-3}. We compare our analytical\nrelation to the results of numerical simulations, and also discuss the effects\nof dust grains on the core formation timescale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Sep 2000 21:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The thin disc model of line profiles in AGN and in X-ray binaries should\nbe bench marked against other plausible possibilities. One proposed alternative\nis an engine consisting of dense clouds embedded in an optically thin,\ngeometrically thick X-ray emitting engine. This model is further motivated by\nstudies of geometrically thick engines such as advection dominated accretion\nflows (ADAFs).

When the generation\nof light pseudoscalar mesons is manifestly incorporated one deals with an\nextension of the chiral quark model (CQM) with the non-linear realization of\nchiral symmetry. If a model is built at the CSB scale by means of perturbation\ntheory it generalizes the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) one with chiral symmetry\nbroken due to attractive 4-fermion forces in the scalar channel.
