We\ntake into account the \"patchy pattern\" of reionization (HII bubbles), the\ncross-correlations of these ionized regions, the small-scale fluctuations of\nthe matter density field and the contribution from collapsed objects. For an\nopen universe, we find that the power-spectrum $l(l+1)C_l/(2\\pi)$ exhibits a\nplateau of height $10^{-13}$ in the range $10^3 < l < 10^6$. We find that for\nlarge wavenumbers $l > 10^4$ the signal is dominated by the contribution from\ncollapsed halos while for $l < 10^4$ it is governed by the large-scale\ncorrelations of HII bubbles. This implies that one cannot discriminate\nreionization by stars from a quasar-driven scenario since the size of ionized\nregions never dominates the behaviour of the anisotropies. Moreover, the\nsecondary CMB anisotropies arise from a broad range of redshifts (7.5<z<10 for\nthe IGM and 0<z<7 for galactic halos).

As an example, we\nanalyze spatially localized modes supported by a nonlinear impurity in the\ngeneralized nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation and describe three types of\nnonlinear impurity modes --- one- and two-hump symmetric localized modes and\nasymmetric localized modes --- for both focusing and defocusing nonlinearity\nand two different (attractive or repulsive) types of impurity. We obtain an\nanalytical stability criterion for the nonlinear localized modes and consider\nthe case of a power-law nonlinearity in detail. We discuss several scenarios of\nthe instability-induced dynamics of the nonlinear impurity modes, including the\nmode decay or switching to a new stable state, and collapse at the impurity\nsite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Sep 2000 16:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Two fundamental features of stem cell\nsystems - stochastic differentiation of stem cells and the robustness of a\nsystem due to regulation of this differentiation - are found to be general\nproperties of a system of interacting cells exhibiting chaotic intra-cellular\nreaction dynamics and cell division, whose presence does not depend on the\ndetail of the model. It is found that stem cells differentiate into other cell\ntypes stochastically due to a dynamical instability caused by cell-cell\ninteractions, in a manner described by the Isologous Diversification theory.\nThis developmental process is shown to be stable not only with respect to\nmolecular fluctuations but also with respect to removal of cells. With this\ndevelopmental process, the irreversible loss of multipotency accompanying the\nchange from a stem cell to a differentiated cell is shown to be characterized\nby a decrease in the chemical diversity in the cell and of the complexity of\nthe cellular dynamics. The relationship between the division speed and this\nloss of multipotency is also discussed.
