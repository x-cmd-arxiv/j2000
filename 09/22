The high count rates allow us\nto track individual QPO peaks, and we exploit this to develop a QPO folding\ntechnique. In contrast to previous QPO studies with RXTE, we emphasize the high\nenergy QPO properties and report the detection of a QPO in the 60-124 keV\nenergy band. Our technique allows us, for the first time, to measure the phase\nof the QPO harmonics relative to the fundamental. Variation in this phase\ndifference leads to changes in the shape of the QPO profile with energy and\nover time. The strength of the QPO fundamental increases up to 19 keV, but the\ndata do not suggest that the strength continues to increase above this energy.\nIn some cases, the QPO amplitudes in the 30-60 keV and 60-124 keV energy bands\nare significantly less than in the 13-19 keV and 19-29 keV energy bands. We\nalso use our technique to measure the phase lag of the QPO fundamental and\nharmonics.

The MLM is based on the\nnetwork likelihood ratio (LR), which is a function of eight signal-parameters\nthat determine the Newtonian inspiral waveform. In the MLM-based strategy, the\nLR must be maximized over all of these parameters. Here, we show that it is\npossible to maximize it analytically over four of the eight parameters.\nMaximization over a fifth parameter, the time of arrival, is handled most\nefficiently by using the Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm. This allows us to\nscan the parameter space continuously over these five parameters and also cuts\ndown substantially on the computational costs. Maximization of the LR over the\nremaining three parameters is handled numerically. This includes the\nconstruction of a bank of templates on this reduced parameter space.
