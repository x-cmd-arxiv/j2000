Imaging polarimetry has shown that NLRGs\nincluding our targets often have large scattering regions of a few kpc to >~10\nkpc scale.

This theory has been conjectured to have a\nholographic dual description in terms of N=2 Landau-Ginzburg theory and\nLiouville theory. If the Landau-Ginzburg description precisely reflects the\ninformation of ADE singularity, the Landau-Ginzburg model of $D_4,E_6,E_8$ and\nGepner model of $A_2\\otimes A_2, A_2\\otimes A_3, A_2\\otimes A_4$ should give\nthe same result. We compute the elements of $D_4,E_6,E_8$ modular invariants\nfor the singular Calabi-Yau compactification in terms of the spectral flow\ninvariant orbits of the tensor product theories with the theta function which\nencodes the momentum mode of the Liouville theory. Furthermore we find the\ninteresting identity among characters in minimal models at different levels. We\ngive the complete proof for the identity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Sep 2000 13:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
