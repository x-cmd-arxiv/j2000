It is now well established\nthat two-body collisions play for matter waves a role analogous to that of a\nKerr nonlinear crystal in optics. In particular, it is known that the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation which describes the condensate supports soliton\nsolutions. For the case of repulsive interactions normally encountered in BEC\nexperiments, the simplest solutions are dark solitons, that is, 'dips' in the\ndensity profile of the condensate.

In the\nvalidation of a proposed model one often faces the dilemma that it is hard to\ndecide whether possible discrepancies between the time series and model output\nare caused by an inappropriate model or by bad estimates of parameters in a\ncorrect type of model, or both. We propose a combination of parametric\nmodelling based on Bock's multiple shooting algorithm and nonparametric\nmodelling based on optimal transformations as a strategy to test proposed\nmodels and if rejected suggest and test new ones. We exemplify this strategy on\nan experimental time series from a chaotic circuit where we obtain an extremely\naccurate reconstruction of the observed attractor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2000 16:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It manifests itself\nthrough a dominance of single-particle and quadrupole-quadrupole terms in the\nHamiltonian used to describe well-deformed nuclei. A practical consequence of\nthe quasi-SU(3) symmetry is an efficient basis truncation scheme. In a recent\nwork was shown that when this type of Hamiltonian is diagonalized in an SU(3)\nbasis, only a few irreducible represntations (irreps) of SU(3) are needed to\ndescribe the Yrast band, the leading S = 0 irrep augmented with the leading S =\n1 irreps in the proton and neutron subspaces. In the present article the\nquasi-SU(3) truncation scheme is used, in conjunction with a \"realistic but\nschematic\" Hamiltonian that includes the most important multipole terms, to\ndescribe the energy spectra and B(E2) transition strengths of 20-Ne, 22-Ne,\n24-Mg and 28-Si.
