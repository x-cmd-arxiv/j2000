The spectra were gathered with the HIRES\nechelle at the Keck Observatory. Some of these objects are stellar and others\nare substellar (or ambiguous). Early indications that such objects can be\nrapidly rotating but display little H-alpha emission turn out to be commonly\ntrue. This is the opposite of the relation between rotation and activity in\nsolar-type stars. The H-alpha surface flux drops precipitously at the bottom of\nthe main sequence, and seems to be related to the luminosity or temperature of\nthe objects. There is a general trend to higher rotation velocities as one\nlooks at objects of lower luminosity. I discuss several possible explanations\nfor these results. The dynamos for these objects are probably fully turbulent,\ndriven by convection, and thus more directly related to the object's\nluminosity. They may be quenched when the rotational velocities become too fast\nin comparison to the convective velocities\n  (supersaturation). Another possibility is that the atmospheres of the cooler\nobjects are becoming sufficiently neutral to decouple atmospheric motions from\nthe field. Either of these could explain why young brown dwarfs can be\nmagnetically active while older brown dwarfs are not. A final possibility is\nthat instead of being quenched, the field configuration in rapid rotators\nchanges to a less conducive form for dissipative heating. This could explain\nwhy flares are occasionally seen on generally inactive objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2000 18:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The flows are geodesic acoustic modes (GAM), which are primarily driven\nby the Stringer-Winsor term. The flow amplitude together with the average\nanomalous transport sensitively depend on the GAM frequency and on the magnetic\ncurvature acting on the flows, which could be influenced in a real tokamak,\ne.g., by shaping the plasma cross section. The local modulation of the\nturbulence by the flows and the excitation of the flows are due to wave-kinetic\neffects, which have been studied for the first time in a turbulence simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2000 21:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

For a simple\nexample of a two-center electron transfer system we discuss some aspects of the\nefficiency of these methods to integrate the equations of motion.
