A low-frequency (33\nmHz) heating method is used to increase the resolution, and to determine the\ntemperature gradient reliably in high magnetic fields. Samples are mounted\nbetween two thermal blocks which are heated by a sinusoidal frequency f0 with a\np/2 phase difference. The phase difference between two heater currents gives a\ntemperature gradient at 2f0. The corresponding thermopower and Nernst effect\nsignals are extracted by using a digital signal processing method due. An\nimportant component of the method involves a superconducting link, YBa2Cu3O7+d\n(YBCO), which is mounted in parallel with sample to remove the background\nmagnetothermopower of the lead wires. The method is demonstrated for the quasi\ntwo-dimensional organic conductor a-(BEDT-TTF)2KHg(SCN)4, which exhibits a\ncomplex, magnetic field dependent ground state above 22.5 T at low\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2000 21:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Transferring the dual operation from the current to the field tensor\nshows that this interaction may be reinterpreted as due to the interaction of\nan effective vector potential and a current, and the AC and HMW effects follow\nimmediately. A general proof of this for particles with an arbitrary spin is\nprovided.\n  The restriction to 2+1 dimensions, with this interpretation, provides a\nunified way of treating the AC and HMW effects for an arbitrary spin.
