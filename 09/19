Eight\ninterstellar absorption components can be identified in the velocity range from\n-200 km/s to +200 km/s. Column densities are determined for Fe II, Mg I, Mg II,\nO I, S II, Si II, and Zn II. From the ion ratios, we estimate electron\ndensities and temperatures of the gas in these components. In addition, we\nrederive column density profiles for the higher ionisation stages Al III, Si\nIV, and C IV for the entire line of sight.\n  Of special interest are the absorption components at positive velocities,\nwhich are associated with the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the foreground of\nM81. The medium has many gas components, as known from radio measurements,\nprobably released in dynamical interactions by galaxies in the M81 group. The\nIUE spectra contain the only UV absorption information on such gas. We find\nneutral and ionised gas absorption at the same velocity, having a metal content\nsimilar to a galactic disk.\n  We combine the spectra towards SN 1993J in M81 with those towards SN 1987A in\nthe LMC, the directions being essentially antipodes on the celestical sphere.\nComparing the total profile with QSO spectra, we conclude that most absorption\nin QSO spectra occurs in diffuse clouds on those sight lines and is not similar\nto absorption by galactic disk gas. However, one absorption component towards\nSN 1993J is clearly very similar to some of the absorption components in QSO\nspectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2000 13:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Scalar masses get contributions from both anomaly\nmediation and a tiny hard breaking of supersymmetry by operators on the\nhidden-sector boundary. These operators contribute to scalar masses at one loop\nand in most of parameter space, their contribution dominates. Thus it is easy\nto make all squared scalar masses positive.

DDH and other commentators (initially including BJSW) suggested\nthat these empirical bounds alone do give sufficient reassurance. This seems\nunsupportable when the bounds are expressed in terms of expected cost -- a good\nmeasure, according to standard risk analysis arguments. For example, DDH's main\nbound, $p_{\\rm catastrophe} < 2 \\times 10^{-8}$, implies only that the\nexpectation value of the number of deaths is bounded by 120. This paper\nreappraises the DDH and BJSW risk bounds by comparing risk policy in other\nareas. For example, it is noted that, even if highly risk tolerant assumptions\nare made and no value is placed on the lives of future generations, a\ncatastrophe risk no higher than $\\approx 10^{-15}$ per year would be required\nfor consistency with established policy for radiation hazard risk minimization.\nIt is concluded that the costs of small risks of catastrophe have been\nsignificantly underestimated by BJSW (initially), by DDH and by other\ncommentators.
