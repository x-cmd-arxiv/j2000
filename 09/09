This information can be\nvaluable in trying to determine the origin of the Broad Line Region (BLR) in\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we explore various scenarios for\nthe cloud formation based on the underlying principle that the source of plasma\nis ultimately that portion of the gas trapped by the central black hole from\nthe interstellar medium. Based on what we know about the Galactic Center, it is\nlikely that in highly dynamic environments such as this, the supply of matter\nis due mostly to stellar winds from the central cluster. Winds accreting onto a\ncentral black hole are subjected to several disturbances capable of producing\nshocks, including a Bondi-Hoyle flow, stellar wind-wind collisions, and\nturbulence. Shocked gas is initially compressed and heated out of thermal\nequilibrium with the ambient radiation field; a cooling instability sets in as\nthe gas is cooled via inverse-Compton and bremsstrahlung processes. If the\ncooling time is less than the dynamical flow time through the shock region, the\ngas may clump to form the clouds responsible for broad line emission seen in\nmany AGN spectra. Clouds produced by this process display the correct range of\ndensities and velocity fields seen in broad emission lines. Very importantly,\nthe cloud distribution agrees with the results of reverberation studies, in\nwhich it is seen that the central line peak responds slower to continuum\nchanges than the line wings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2000 22:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A cubic grain is discretized\ninto 64 cubic subgrains and the coupled gyromagnetic equations of motion are\nsolved without phenomenological damping. A new scheme to solve these equations\nis developed that utilizes only two variables per sub-cube magnetization and\nstrictly conserves the absolute magnitude. The initial stage of reversal is\nuniform rotation followed by a nonlinear excitation of nonuniform magnetic\noscillations driven by this uniform mode. An excess of the initial Zeeman\nenergy is transformed into nonlinear spin waves, allowing the average\nmagnetization to substantially reverse. The process of magnetization reversal\nin fine quasi-single-domain grain exhibits general features of Hamiltonian wave\nsystems with nonlinear diffusion. This nonlinear diffusion is forbidden for\neither a strong reversal field and/or a small grain size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2000 22:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

At low intensity, the atomic reflection process is\ncontrolled by two separate mechanisms both of which are modified by the\npresence of the metallic sheet and influenced by the use of the field-dipole\norientation picture. The first mechanism involves the spontaneous force which\naccelerates the atom parallel to the sheet plane.
