We show that quasar clustering measurements can\nsubstantially narrow the range of possible lifetimes with the assumption that\nluminous quasars reside in the most massive host halos. If quasars are\nlong-lived, then they are rare phenomena that are highly biased with respect to\nthe underlying dark matter, while if they are short-lived they reside in more\ntypical halos that are less strongly clustered. For a given quasar lifetime, we\ncalculate the minimum host halo mass by matching the observed space density of\nquasars, using the Press-Schechter approximation. We use the results of Mo &\nWhite to calculate the clustering of these halos, and hence of the quasars they\ncontain, as a function of quasar lifetime. A lifetime of t_Q = 4 x 10^7 years,\nthe e-folding timescale of an Eddington luminosity black hole with accretion\nefficiency eps=0.1, corresponds to a quasar correlation length r_0 ~ 10 Mpc/h\nin low-density cosmological models at z=2-3; this value is consistent with\ncurrent clustering measurements, but these have large uncertainties.\nHigh-precision clustering measurements from the 2dF and Sloan quasar surveys\nwill test our key assumption of a tight correlation between quasar luminosity\nand host halo mass, and if this assumption holds then they should determine t_Q\nto a factor of three or better.
