Images at wavelengths\nranging from 5 to 24.5 microns show unequivocally that the optically fainter\nbinary, HD 98800B, is the sole source of a comparatively large infrared excess\nupon which a silicate emission feature is superposed. The excess is detected\nonly at wavelengths of 7.9 microns and longer, peaks at 25 microns, and has a\nbest-fit black-body temperature of 150 K, indicating that most of the dust lies\nat distances greater than the orbital separation of the spectroscopic binary.\nWe estimate the radial extent of the dust with a disk model that approximates\nradiation from the spectroscopic binary as a single source of equivalent\nluminosity. Given the data, the most-likely values of disk properties in the\nranges considered are R_in = 5.0 +/- 2.5 AU, DeltaR = 13+/-8 AU, lambda_0 =\n2(+4/-1.5) microns, gamma = 0+/-2.5, and sigma_total = 16+/-3 AU^2, where R_in\nis the inner radius, DeltaR is the radial extent of the disk, lambda_0 is the\neffective grain size, gamma is the radial power-law exponent of the optical\ndepth, tau, and sigma_total is the total cross-section of the grains.
