In optically thin clouds, the growth rate of small isobaric\ndensity perturbations is independent of their length scale. However, the growth\nof a perturbation is limited by its transition from isobaric to isochoric\ncooling. The temperature at which this transition occurs decreases with the\nlength scale of the perturbation. Consequently small scale perturbations have\nthe potential to reach higher amplitudes than large scale perturbations. When\nthe amplitude becomes nonlinear, advection overtakes the pressure gradient in\npromoting the compression resulting in an accelerated growth of the\ndisturbance. The critical temperature for transition depends on the initial\namplitude. The fluctuations which can first reach nonlinearity before their\nisobaric to isochoric transition will determine the characteristic size and\nmass of the cold dense clumps which would emerge from the cooling of an\ninitially nearly homogeneous region of gas. Thermal conduction is in general\nvery efficient in erasing isobaric, small-scale fluctuations, suppressing a\ncooling instability. A weak, tangled magnetic field can however reduce the\nconductive heat flux enough for low-amplitude fluctuations to grow isobarically\nand become non-linear if their length scales are of order 0.01 pc. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how a 2-phase medium, with cold clumps being pressure confined in a\ndiffuse hot residual background component, would be sustained if there is\nadequate heating to compensate the energy loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Feb 2000 16:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The metallic AALs range in ionization from C III and N\nIII to Ne VIII and Mg X. We use these data and photoionization models to derive\nthe following properties of the AAL gas: 1) There are multiple ionization zones\nwithin the AAL region, spanning a factor of at least ~50 in ionization\nparameter. 2) The overall ionization is consistent with the ``warm'' X-ray\ncontinuum absorbers measured in Seyfert 1 nuclei and other QSOs.

Light-front potentials for\ntwo-nucleon bound states are calculated using two approaches. First,\nlight-front time-ordered perturbation theory is used to calculate one- and\ntwo-meson-exchange potentials. These potentials give results that agree well\nwith the ladder and ladder plus crossed box Bethe-Salpeter spectra. Secondly,\napproximations that incorporate non-perturbative physics are used to calculate\nalternative one-meson-exchange potentials. These non-perturbative potentials\ngive better agreement with the spectra of the full non-perturbative\nground-state calculation than the perturbative potentials. For lightly-bound\nstates, all of the approaches appear to agree with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2000 02:11:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2000 23:51:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
