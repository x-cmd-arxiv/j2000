In this paper, we generalize this result to not\nnecessarily finite-dimensional cotriangular Hopf algebras. Namely, our main\nresult says that a cotriangular Hopf algebra A over k is obtained from a\nfunction algebra of a pro-algebraic group by twisting by a Hopf 2-cocycle, and\npossibly changing its R-form by a central grouplike element of A^* of order\n<=2, IF AND ONLY IF the trace of squared antipode on any finite-dimensional\nsubcoalgebra of A is the dimension of this subcoalgebra. This generalization,\nlike the original theorem, is proved using Deligne's theorem on Tannakian\ncategories.\n  In the second half of the paper, we give examples of twisted function\nalgebras. In particular, we show that in the infinite- dimensional case, the\nsquared antipode may not equal the identity. On the other hand, we show that in\nall of our examples of twisted function algebras, the squared antipode is\nunipotent, and conjecture it to be the case for any twisted function algebra.\nWe prove this conjecture in a large number of special cases, using the\nquantization theory of the first author and D.Kazhdan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2000 02:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
