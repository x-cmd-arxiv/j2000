The observed structure of the debris disk in the solar system, i.e.,\nthe zodiacal cloud, also contains asymmetries: it has an offset center of\nsymmetry, it is warped, and there is an asymmetric ring of dust co-orbiting\nwith the Earth. Since the zodiacal cloud's asymmetries have been shown to be\nsignatures of the gravitational perturbations of the solar system's planets, it\nis hoped that it may be possible to indirectly detect extrasolar planetary\nsystems by their signatures in debris disk observations. This dissertation uses\nthe physical processes that affect the evolution of debris material in the\nsolar system to create a generalized model for the evolution of circumstellar\ndebris material.

The wind forms a low-density bubble surrounded by a swept-up shell of\ninterstellar matter. Gamma rays are produced as a result of decay of pions\nwhich in turn are the result of collisions of CRs with nuclei of the thermal\nplasma. The time evolution of the SNRs is followed numerically, taking into\naccount the nonlinear backreaction of the accelerated CRs. Examples typical for\nSN type Ib and SN type II explosions are considered. Apart from the\nconfirmation of the known fact that acceleration is extremely rapid and that\nthe upper momentum cutoff is reached almost immediately after the explosion due\nto the high wind magnetic field, it is also shown that the CRs are accelerated\nwith high efficiency.

It has been applied successfully to the\ncases of {\\it non-rotating}, {\\it non-distorted} black holes in Einstein\nVacuum, Einstein-Maxwell and Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Theories. In this note,\nit is investigated the extent to which the framework can be generalized to the\ncase of non-Abelian gauge theories where `hairy black holes' are known to\nexist. It is found that this extension is indeed possible, despite the fact\nthat in general, there is no `canonical normalization' yielding a preferred\nHorizon Mass. In particular the zeroth and first laws are established for all\nnormalizations. Colored static spherically symmetric black hole solutions to\nthe Einstein-Yang-Mills equations are considered from this perspective. A\ncanonical formula for the Horizon Mass of such black holes is found. This\nanalysis is used to obtain nontrivial relations between the masses of the\ncolored black holes and the regular solitonic solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills\ntheory. A general testing bed for the instability of hairy black holes in\ngeneral non-linear theories is suggested. As an example, the embedded Abelian\nmagnetic solutions are considered. It is shown that, within this framework, the\ntotal energy is also positive and thus, the solutions are potentially unstable.\nFinally, it is discussed which elements would be needed to place the Isolated\nHorizons framework for Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in the same footing as the\npreviously analyzed cases. Motivated by these considerations and using the fact\nthat the Isolated Horizons framework seems to be the appropriate language to\nstate uniqueness and completeness conjectures for the EYM equations --in terms\nof the horizon charges--, two such conjectures are put forward.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2000 01:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}

Traditional boundary integral methods applied\nto problems with corner singularities involve a (real) boundary integral\nequation with a kernel containing a logarithmic singularity.

We con-\nstruct the initial perturbation as a piecewise linear analog of the Weierstrass\nfunction. The wavenumbers of this function form a \"Weierstrass spectrum\", which\naccumulates at the origin in geometric progression.\"Reverse\" sawtooth functions\nwith negative initial slope are used in this series as basic functions, while\ntheir amplitudes are chosen by the condition that the distribution of energy\nover exponential intervals of wavenumbers is the same as for the continuous\nspectrum in Burgers turbulence. Combining these two ideas allows us to obtain\nan exact analytical solution for the velocity field. We also notice that such\nmultiscale waves may be constructed for multidimensional Burgers' equation.\n  This solution has scaling exponent h=-(1+n)/2 and its evolution in time is\nself-similar with logarithmic periodicity and with the same average law L(t) as\nfor Burgers turbulence. Shocklines form self-similar regular tree-like struc-\ntures. This model also describes important properties of the Burgers turbulence\nsuch as the self-preservation of the evolution of large scale structures in the\npresence of small scales perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2000 17:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
