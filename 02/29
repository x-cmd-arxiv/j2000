In this letter we discuss the cosmological implications of\na fractal distribution of matter, with a possible cross-over to homogeneity at\nan undetermined scale R_{homo}. Contrary to what is generally assumed, we show\nthat, even when R_{homo} -> \\infty, this possibility can be treated\nconsistently within the framework of the expanding universe solutions of\nFriedmann. The fractal is a perturbation to an open cosmology in which the\nleading homogeneous component is the cosmic background radiation (CBR). This\ncosmology, inspired by the observed galaxy distributions, provides a simple\nexplanation for the recent data which indicate the absence of deceleration in\nthe expansion (q_o \\approx 0). Correspondingly the `age problem' is also\nresolved. Further we show that the model can be extended back from the\ncurvature dominated arbitrarily deep into the radiation dominated era, and we\ndiscuss qualitatively the modifications to the physics of the anisotropy of the\nCBR, nucleosynthesis and structure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2000 16:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
