Because X-ray telescopes utilize\ngrazing optics, to collect more photons requires a larger acceptance angle\nwhich in turn compromises the angular resolution. All X-ray telescopes thus\nhave angular resolution far poorer than their diffraction limit. Although\ncollecting more photons is a desirable goal, sometimes selective collecting\nfewer photons may yield more information. Natural (such as lunar) occultations\nhave long been used to study sources on small angular scales. But natural\nocculters are of limited utility because of their large angular velocities\nrelative to the telescope, and because of the serendipity of their transits. We\ndescribe here how one can make use of an X-ray Big Occulting Steerable\nSatellite (X-BOSS) to achieve very-high resolution of X-ray sources. An X-BOSS\ncould significantly improve the resolution of existing X-ray facilities such as\nthe Chandra telescope, or X-ray Multiple Mirror (XMM) satellite, and could\nvastly improve the resolution of some future X-ray telescopes, particularly\nConstellation X where sub-milliarcsecond resolution is possible for a wide\nrange of sources.

We start from the\nstandard picture of disk formation through the settling of gas into a dark halo\npotential well, with the disk initially coming into centrifugal equilibrium\nwith detailed conservation of angular momentum. We derive generic analytic\nsolutions for the disk-halo system after adiabatic compression of the dark\nhalo, with free choice of the input virialized dark halo density profile and of\nthe specific angular momentum distribution. We derive limits on the final\ndensity profile of the halo in the central regions. Subsequent viscous\nevolution of the disk is modelled by a variation of the specific angular\nmomentum distribution of the disk, providing analytic solutions to the final\ndisk structure. The assumption that the viscous evolution timescale and star\nformation timescale are similar leads to predictions of the properties of the\nstellar components. Focusing on small `exponential' bulges, ones that may be\nformed through a disk instability, we investigate the relationship between the\nassumed initial conditions, such as halo `formation', or assembly, redshift\n$z_f$, spin parameter $\\lambda$, baryonic fraction $F$, and final disk\nproperties such as global star formation timescale, gas fraction, and\nbulge-to-disk ratio.

Using a simple model for\nthe formation and evolution of dark halos, based on the extended\nPress-Schechter formalism and tested against N-body results, we show that the\ntheoretical predictions can be reconciled with observations if gas accretion in\nlow-mass halos is suppressed after the epoch of reionization. In this picture,\nthe observed dwarf satellites correspond to the small fraction of halos that\naccreted substantial amounts of gas before reionization. The photoionization\nmechanism naturally explains why the discrepancy between predicted halos and\nobserved satellites sets in at about 30 km/s, and for reasonable choices of the\nreionization redshift (z_re = 5-12) the model can reproduce both the amplitude\nand shape of the observed velocity function of galactic satellites.

In Cyg X-2, RXTE-ASM data show strong peaks at 40.4 and 68.8 days,\nand Ginga-ASM data show strong peaks at 53.7 and 61.3 days. Multiple peaks are\nalso observed in LMC X-3. The various strong peaks in the periodograms of LMC\nX-3 appear at 104, 169, and 216 days (observed with RXTE-ASM) and 105, 214, and\n328 days (observed with Ginga-ASM). The present results, when compared with the\nearlier observations of periodicities in these two systems, demonstrate the\nabsence of any stable long period. The 78 day periodicity detected earlier in\nCyg X-2 was probably due to the short time base in the RXTE data that were\nused, and the periodicity of 198 days in LMC X-3 was due to a relatively short\nduration of observation with HEAO 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Feb 2000 08:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Exact bound states, or breather modes, exist in the unperturbed\nproblem and are found to be generically metastable in the presence of small\nperiodic perturbations.
