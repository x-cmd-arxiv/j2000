Global SLS-resolution is linear for query evaluation but suffers from\ninfinite loops and redundant computations. In contrast, SLG-resolution resolves\ninfinite loops and redundant computations by means of tabling, but it is not\nlinear. The principal disadvantage of a non-linear approach is that it cannot\nbe implemented using a simple, efficient stack-based memory structure nor can\nit be easily extended to handle some strictly sequential operators such as cuts\nin Prolog.\n  In this paper, we present a linear tabling method, called SLT-resolution, for\ntop-down evaluation of the well-founded semantics. SLT-resolution is a\nsubstantial extension of SLDNF-resolution with tabling. Its main features\ninclude: (1) It resolves infinite loops and redundant computations while\npreserving the linearity. (2) It is terminating, and sound and complete w.r.t.\nthe well-founded semantics for programs with the bounded-term-size property\nwith non-floundering queries. Its time complexity is comparable with\nSLG-resolution and polynomial for function-free logic programs. (3) Because of\nits linearity for query evaluation, SLT-resolution bridges the gap between the\nwell-founded semantics and standard Prolog implementation techniques.

Second, how is irreversibility that occurs in\nmaking a measurement explained in terms of a neurophysiological mechanism where\na macroscopic measuring instrument is not required in principle to make the\nmeasurement, as in macroscopic quantum tunneling?
