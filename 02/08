I show that this characteristic scale can be up to an\norder of magnitude lower than the linear theory Jeans mass, and that even if\none defines the Jeans mass at a higher overdensity, it does not track the\nevolution of this characteristic suppression mass. Instead, the filtering mass,\nwhich corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are\nsmoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the\ncharacteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of reionization on\nstructure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a\nsingle characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. In\ncontrast to the Jeans mass, the filtering mass depends on the full thermal\nhistory of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so it\naccounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gas\ndistribution in the expanding universe. In addition to the characteristic\nsuppression mass, I study the full shape of the probability distribution to\nfind an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same total\nmass, and I show that the numerical results can be described by a simple\nfitting formula that again depends only on the filtering mass.

The nonlinear biasing is characterized by the\nconditional mean of the galaxy density fluctuation given the underlying mass\ndensity fluctuation, or by the associated parameters of mean biasing and\nnonlinearity (following Dekel & Lahav 1999). Using the distribution of galaxies\nin cosmological simulations, at smoothing of a few Mpc, we find that the mean\nbiasing can be recovered to a good accuracy from the cumulative distribution\nfunctions (CDFs) of galaxies and mass, despite the biasing scatter. Then, using\na suite of simulations of different cosmological models, we demonstrate that\nthe matter CDF is robust compared to the difference between it and the galaxy\nCDF, and can be approximated for our purpose by a cumulative log-normal\ndistribution of 1+\\delta with a single parameter \\sigma. Finally, we show how\nthe nonlinear biasing function can be obtained with adequate accuracy directly\nfrom the observed galaxy CDF in redshift space. Thus, the biasing function can\nbe obtained from counts in cells once the rms mass fluctuation at the\nappropriate scale is assumed a priori. The relative biasing function between\ndifferent galaxy types is measurable in a similar way. The main source of error\nis sparse sampling, which requires that the mean galaxy separation be smaller\nthan the smoothing scale.

In this work, the\nstatistics of the passive magnetic field in the diffusion-free regime are\nconsidered for the case when the advecting flow is finite-time correlated. A\nnew method is developed that allows one to systematically construct the\ncorrelation-time expansion for statistical characteristics of the field. The\nexpansion is valid provided the velocity correlation time is smaller than the\ncharacteristic growth time of the magnetic fluctuations. This expansion is\ncarried out up to first order in the general case of a d-dimensional\narbitrarily compressible advecting flow. The growth rates for all moments of\nthe magnetic field are derived. The effect of the first-order corrections is to\nreduce these growth rates. It is shown that introducing a finite correlation\ntime leads to the loss of the small-scale statistical universality, which was\npresent in the limit of the delta-correlated velocity field. Namely, the shape\nof the velocity time-correlation profile and the large-scale spatial structure\nof the flow become important. The latter is a new effect, that implies, in\nparticular, that the approximation of a locally-linear shear flow does not\nfully capture the effect of nonvanishing correlation time.

The high degree (P_k ~ 25%) and orientation\nof the extended polarization feature are consistent with a scattering origin.\nMost plausibly, the detection of polarization along only one limb of the bicone\nis a consequence of intrinsic anisotropy of the near-IR continuum within the\nradiation cones, with the direction of maximum intensity of the near-IR\nradiation field significantly displaced from the direction of the radio axis.\nThe unresolved nuclear core source is also highly polarized (P_k > 28%), with a\nposition angle close to the perpendicular to the radio axis. Given that this\nhigh degree of nuclear polarization can only be explained in terms of dichroic\nextinction if the dichroic mechanism is unusually efficient in Cygnus A, it is\nmore likely that the nuclear polarization is due to the scattering of nuclear\nlight in an unresolved scattering region close to the AGN.

The space-time on one side of such a wall is asymptotic to\nthe Cauchy horizon of the anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time. However, on the\nother side there is a naked singularity. The higher-dimensional embedding of\nthese solutions has the novel interpretation of (sphere compactified) brane\nconfigurations in the domain ``inside the horizon region,'' with the\nsingularity corresponding to the sphere shrinking to zero volume. The naked\nsingularity is the source of an infinite attractive gravitational potential for\nthe fluctuating modes. Nevertheless, the spectrum is bounded from below,\ncontinuous and positive definite, with the wave functions suppressed in the\nregion close to the singularity. The massless bound state is formally excluded\ndue to the boundary condition for the fluctuating mode wave functions at the\nnaked singularity. However, a regularisation of the naked singularity, for\nexample by effects of the order of the inverse string scale, in turn\nregularises the gravitational potential and allows for precisely one (massless)\nbound-state spin-2 fluctuating mode. We also contrast spectra in these domain\nwall backgrounds with those of the domain walls due to the massless modes of\nsphere reductions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Feb 2000 19:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

On the other hand, there are notions of log terminal and log\ncanonical singularities defined via resolutions of singularities in\ncharacteristic zero.
