The disc expands during rise to maximum and shrinks\nduring decline and along the quiescent period. At the end of two outbursts the\nsystem was seen to go through a phase of lower brightness, characterized by an\nout-of-eclipse level ~15 per cent lower than the typical quiescent level and by\nthe fairly symmetric eclipse of a compact source at disc centre with little\nevidence of a bright spot at disc rim. New eclipse timings were measured and a\nrevised ephemeris was derived. The residuals with respect to the linear\nephemeris are well described by a sinusoid of amplitude 1.2 minutes and period\n\\~4 years and are possibly related to a solar-like magnetic activity cycle in\nthe secondary star. Eclipse phases of the compact central source and of the\nbright spot were used to derive the geometry of the binary. By constraining the\ngas stream trajectory to pass through the observed position of the bright spot\nwe find q=0.72+/-0.06 and i= 85 +3/-2 degrees.

This refocusing originates a Polarization Echo whose amplitude\nattenuates by increasing the time $t_R$ elapsed until the dynamics is reversed.\nDifferent functional attenuations are found for a set of dipolar coupled\nsystems: ferrocene, (C$_5$H$_5$)$_2$Fe, cymantrene, (C$_5$H$_5$)Mn(CO)$_3$, and\ncobaltocene, (C$_5$H$_5$)$_2$Co. To control a relevant variable involved in\nthis attenuation a pulse sequence has been devised to progressively reduce the\ndipolar dynamics. Since it reduces the evolution of the polarization echo it is\nreferred as REPE sequence. Two extreme behaviors were found while\ncharacterizing the materials: In systems with a strong source of relaxation and\nslow dynamics, the attenuation follows an exponential law (cymantrene). In\nsystems with a strong dipolar dynamics the attenuation is mainly Gaussian. By\nthe application of the REPE sequence the characteristic time of the Gaussian\ndecay is increased until the presence of an underlying dissipative mechanism is\nrevealed (cobaltocene). For ferrocene, however, the attenuation remains\nGaussian within the experimental time scale. These two behaviors suggest that\nthe many body quantum dynamics presents an extreme intrinsic instability which,\nin the presence of small perturbations, leads to the onset of irreversibility.\nThis experimental conclusion is consistent with the tendencies displayed by the\nnumerical solutions of model systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2000 20:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Results for valence nucleons in nuclear degenerate sdg\nmajor shell show that the strongly coupled zero angular momentum nucleon pairs\ncan be substituted by weakly coupled q-deformed zero angular momentum nucleon\npairs. A study of Sn isotopes reveals a well defined universe of (G, q) values,\nfor which qBCS converges. While the qBCS and BCS show similar results for Gap\nparameter Delta in Sn isotopes, the ground state energies are lower in qBCS.\nThe pairing correlations in N nucleon system, increase with increasing q (for q\nreal).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2000 12:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The\nphase dynamics are governed by a ``driven-pendulum'' equation, as in\ncurrent-driven superconducting Josephson junctions. At a critical velocity of\nthe barrier (proportional to the critical tunneling current), there is a sharp\ntransition between the ``dc'' and ``ac'' regimes. The signature is a sudden\njump of a large fraction of the relative condensate population. Analytical\npredictions are compared with a full numerical solution of the time dependent\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, in an experimentally realistic situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2000 18:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We show that for any $q,t > 1$,\n$\\MOD_q$ is equivalent to $\\MOD_t$ (up to constant depth). Based on the case\n$q=2$, Moore \\cite{moore99} has shown that quantum analogs of AC$^{(0)}$,\nACC$[q]$, and ACC, denoted QAC$^{(0)}_{wf}$, QACC$[2]$, QACC respectively,\ndefine the same class of operators, leaving $q > 2$ as an open question. Our\nresult resolves this question, proving that QAC$^{(0)}_{wf} =$ QACC$[q] = $\nQACC for all $q$. We also develop techniques for proving upper bounds for QACC\nin terms of related language classes. We define classes of languages EQACC,\nNQACC and BQACC$_{\\rats}$. We define a notion $\\log$-planar QACC operators and\nshow the appropriately restricted versions of EQACC and NQACC are contained in\nP/poly.

To do this last proof, we show that TC$^{(0)}$ can perform iterated\naddition and multiplication in certain field extensions.
