This can be interpreted as evidence for a fast outer\nshell, and we adopt a spherically symmetric model to constrain the properties\nof this. We find that the density appears to decrease outward in the shell. A\nlower limit to the mass is 0.3 solar masses with an accompanying kinetic energy\nof 1.5EE{49} ergs. A massive 10^{51} erg shell cannot be excluded, but is less\nlikely if the density profile is much steeper than R^{-4} and the velocity is\n<6000 km/s. The observations cover the region 1140-1720 A. With the time-tag\nmode of the spectrograph we obtain the pulse profile. It is similar to that in\nthe near-UV, although the primary peak is marginally narrower. Together with\nthe near-UV data, and new optical data from NOT, our spectrum of the pulsar\ncovers the entire region from 1140-9250 A. Dereddening the spectrum gives a\nflat spectrum for E(B-V)=0.52, R=3.1. This dereddened spectrum of the Crab\npulsar can be fitted by a power law with spectral index alpha_{\\nu} = 0.11 +/-\n0.04. The main uncertainty is the amount and characteristics of the interstel-\nlar reddening, and we have investigated the dependence of \\alpha_{\\nu} on\nE(B-V) and R. In the extended emission covered by our 25\" x 0.5\" slit in the\nfar-UV, we detect C IV 1550 and He II 1640 emission lines from the Crab nebula.\nSeveral interstellar absorption lines are detected toward the pulsar.

The problem is local, and therefore we can consider\nthe case when our surface is ${\\bf R^4}$ with an arbitrary almost-complex\nstructure $J$ of class $C^{1.\\alpha}$. Let $C$ be a non-singular $J$-complex\ncurve passing through the origin. Our result cah be stated as follows: There\nexists a basis $\\{U_j\\}$ of neighborhoods of zero in ${\\bf R^4}$, such that\n$(U_j,J)$ are complete hyperbolic in the sence of Kobayashi, moreover\n$(U_j\\setminus C,J)$ are complete hyperbolic as well.\n  The fact that this result remains true for any almost-complex structure is\nsomewhat suprising. Really, given any germ of a non-singular real surface $C\\ni\n0$ in ${\\bf R^4}$, one can easily construct an almost-complex structure $J$ in\na neighborhood of zero, such that $C$ becomes a $J$-complex curve.\n  Typical corollary is the following:\n  Let ${\\cal M}_{\\omega, 5l}$ be the Banach manifold consisting of pairs\n$(J,\\{D_j\\}_{j=1}^5)$, where $J$ is any almost-complex structure on ${\\bf\nCP^2}$ tamed by the Fubini-Studi form $\\omega$ and $\\{D_j\\}_{j=1}^5$ the union\nof five $J$-complex lines in ${\\bf CP^2}$ in general position.
