An explanation for the pulse evolution in terms of a freely\nprecessing neutron star is reviewed and shown to have several major\ndifficulties in explaining the observed pulse evolution pattern. Instead, we\npropose a phenomenological model for the pulse evolution based upon an\noccultation of the pulse emitting region by the tilted, inner edge of a\nprecessing accretion disk. The systematic and repeating pulse shape changes\nrequire a resolved occultation of the pulse emission region.

The\nspectral hardness of the pencil beam component suggests an origin at the\nmagnetic polar cap, with the relatively softer fan beam emission produced by\nbackscattering from within the accretion column, qualitatively consistent with\nseveral theoretical models for X-ray emission from the accretion column of an\naccreting neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2000 19:52:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Under a microscope magnifying the ball by the factor $\\sqrt{N}$, the\nstatistics of the configurations of simultaneous zeros of random $k$-tuples of\nsections tends to a universal limit independent of $P,M,L$. We review this\nresult and generalize it further to the case of pre-quantum line bundles over\nalmost-complex symplectic manifolds $(M,J,\\omega)$. Following [SZ2], we replace\n$H^0(M,L^N)$ in the complex case with the `asymptotically holomorphic' sections\ndefined by Boutet de Monvel-Guillemin and (from another point of view) by\nDonaldson and Auroux. Using a generalization to an $m$-dimensional setting of\nthe Kac-Rice formula for zero correlations together with the results of [SZ2],\nwe prove that the scaling limits of the correlation functions for zeros of\nrandom $k$-tuples of asymptotically holomorphic sections belong to the same\nuniversality class as in the complex case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2000 23:27:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2000 21:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
