The radiation force is due to spectral lines and is calculated using a\ngeneralized multidimensional formulation of the Sobolev approximation. The\neffects of the magnetic field are approximated by adding a force that emulates\na magnetocentrifugal force. Our approach allows us to calculate disk winds when\nthe magnetic field controls the flow geometry, forces the flow to corotate with\nthe disk, or both. In particular, we calculate models where the lines of the\npoloidal component of the field are straight and inclined to the disk at a\nfixed angle. Our numerical calculations show that flows which corotate with the\ndisk have a larger mass loss rate than their counterparts which conserve\nspecific angular momentum. The difference in the mass loss rate between these\ntwo types of winds can be several orders of magnitude for low disk luminosities\nbut vanishes for high disk luminosities. Winds which corotate with the disk\nhave much higher velocities than angular momentum conserving winds. Fixing the\nwind geometry stabilizes winds which are unsteady when the geometry is derived\nself-consistently. The inclination angle between the poloidal velocity and the\nnormal to the disk midplane is important. Non-zero inclination angles allow the\nmagnetocentrifugal force to increase the mass loss rate for low luminosities,\nand increase the wind velocity for all luminosities. Our calculations also show\nthat the radiation force can launch winds from magnetized disks. The line force\ncan be essential in producing MHD winds from disks where the thermal energy is\ntoo low to launch winds or where the field lines make an angle of < 30^o with\nrespect to the normal to the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Feb 2000 22:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

At any instant the polar cap is populated as\ndensely as possible with a number of two-dimensional sparks with a\ncharacteristic dimension as well as a typical distance between adjacent sparks\nbeing about the polar gap height. Our model differs, however, markedly from its\noriginal 'hollow cone' version. The key feature is the quasi-central spark\ndriven by pair production process and anchored to the local pole of a\nsunspot-like surface magnetic field. This fixed spark prevents the motion of\nother sparks towards the pole, restricting it to slow circumferential drift\nacross the planes of field lines converging at the local pole. We argue that\nthe polar spark constitutes the core pulsar emission, and that the annular\nrings of drifting sparks contribute to conal components of the pulsar beam. We\nfound that the number of nested cones in the beam of typical pulsar should not\nexcced three; a number also found by Mitra & Deshpande (1999) using a\ncompletely different analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2000 11:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Each\nspark reappears in approximately the same place on the polar cap for a time\nscale much longer than its life-time and delivers to the open magnetosphere a\nsequence of electron-positron clouds which flow orderly along a flux tube of\ndipolar magnetic field lines. The overlapping of particles with different\nmomenta from consecutive clouds leads to effective two-stream instability,\nwhich triggers electrostatic Langmuir waves at the altitudes of about 50\nstellar radii. The electrostatic oscillations are modulationally unstable and\ntheir nonlinear evolution results in formation of ``bunch-like'' charged\nsolitons. A characteristic soliton length along magnetic field lines is about\n30 cm, so they are capable of emitting coherent curvature radiation at radio\nwavelengths.
