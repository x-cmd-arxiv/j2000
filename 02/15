Our results show that entropic effects arising\nfrom the large vibrational amplitude of the oxygen impurity give a major\nreduction of the oxygen chemical potential, so that oxygen dissolved in h.c.p.\niron may be stabilised at concentrations up a few mol % under core conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2000 18:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This\nmotivates us to study the spectral properties also within the Hartree-Fock\napproximation. It already gives power-law behavior and qualitative agreement\nwith the exact spectral function.

The eigenvalues E_R of H are complex. They are the poles of the\nS-matrix and provide both the energies and widths of the states. We illustrate\nthe interplay between Re(H) and Im(H) by means of the different interference\nphenomena between two neighboured resonance states. Level repulsion along the\nreal axis appears if the interaction is caused mainly by Re(H) while a\nbifurcation of the widths appears if the interaction occurs mainly due to\nIm(H). We then calculate the poles of the S-matrix and the corresponding\nwavefunctions for a rectangular microwave resonator with a scatter as a\nfunction of the area of the resonator as well as of the degree of opening to a\nguide. The calculations are performed by using the method of exterior complex\nscaling. Re(W) and Im(W) cause changes in the structure of the wavefunctions\nwhich are permanent, as a rule. At full opening to the lead, short-lived\ncollective states are formed together with long-lived trapped states. The\nwavefunctions of the short-lived states at full opening to the lead are very\ndifferent from those at small opening. The resonance picture obtained from the\nmicrowave resonator shows all the characteristic features known from the study\nof many-body systems in spite of the absence of two-body forces. The poles of\nthe S-matrix determine the conductance of the resonator. Effects arising from\nthe interplay between resonance trapping and level repulsion along the real\naxis are not involved in the statistical theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Feb 2000 17:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-06"}
