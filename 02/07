Correlations found between\ntheir peak frequency, peak flux density and angular size provide strong\nevidence that synchrotron self absorption is the cause of the spectral\nturnovers, and indicate that young radio sources evolve in a self-similar way.\nIn addition, the data seem to suggest that the sources are in equipartition\nwhile they evolve. If GPS sources evolve to large size radio sources, their\nredshift dependent birth-functions should be the same. Therefore, since the\nlifetimes of radio sources are thought to be short compared to the Hubble time,\nthe observed difference in redshift distribution between GPS and large size\nsources must be due to a difference in slope of their luminosity functions.

A scenario for the luminosity evolution is proposed in\nwhich GPS sources increase in luminosity and large scale radio sources decrease\nin luminosity with time. This evolution scenario is expected for a ram-pressure\nconfined radio source in a surrounding medium with a King profile density. In\nthe inner parts of the King profile, the density of the medium is constant and\nthe radio source builds up its luminosity, but after it grows large enough the\ndensity of th e surrounding medium declines and the luminosity of the radio\nsource decreases.

Incorporating also, Einstein's special relativity,\nleads to the quantum theory of fields. Non-relativistic quantum mechanics and\nclassical mechanics are special cases. By studying vacuum expectation values\n(Wightman functions W(n; z) where z denotes the set of n complex variables) of\nproducts of quantum field operators in a separable Hilbert space, one is led to\ncomputation of holomorphy domains for these functions over the space of several\ncomplex variables, C^n. Quantum fields were reconstructed from these functions\nby Wightman. Computer automation has been accomplished as deterministic exact\nanalog computation (computation over \"cells\" in the continuum of C^n) for\nobtaining primitive extended tube domains of holomorphy. This is done in a one\ndimensional space plus one dimensional time model. By considering boundary\nrelated semi-algebraic sets, some analytic extensions of these domains are\nobtained by non-deterministic methods. The novel methods of computation raise\ninteresting issues of computability and complexity. Moreover, the computation\nis independent of any particular form of Lagrangian or dynamics, and is uniform\nin n, qualifying for a universal quantum machine over C^infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Feb 2000 18:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
