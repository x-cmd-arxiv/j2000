During the collapse phase of a\nsupernova, the EOS at subnuclear densities controls the collapse rate, the\namount of deleptonization and thus the size of the collapsing core and the\nbounce density. Properties of nuclear matter that are especially crucial are\nthe symmetry energy and the nuclear specific heat. The nuclear\nincompressibility, and the supernuclear EOS, play supporting roles.

We survey several\nregularization methods: the cutoff method, the complex contour integration\nmethod, and the zeta-function method. The most powerful method in the present\ncase is the contour integration method. The Casimir energy turns out to be\nnegative, and more so the larger is the number of pieces in the string. The\nthermodynamic free energy F is calculated for a two-piece string in the limit\nwhen the tension ratio x=T_{I}/T_{II} approaches zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2000 16:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The calculations begin with\ncorrelated eight-body wave functions that have a filled alpha-like core and\nfour p-shell nucleons LS-coupled to the appropriate (J+/-;T) quantum numbers\nfor the state of interest. After optimization, these variational wave functions\nare used as input to a Green's function Monte Carlo calculation made with a new\nconstrained path algorithm. We find that the Hamiltonian produces an 8Be ground\nstate that is within 2 MeV of the experimental resonance, but the other\neight-body energies are progressively worse as the neutron-proton asymmetry\nincreases. The 8Li ground state is stable against breakup into subclusters, but\nthe 8He ground state is not. The excited state spectra are in fair agreement\nwith experiment, with both the single-particle behavior of 8He and 8Li and the\ncollective rotational behavior of 8Be being reproduced. We also examine energy\ndifferences in the T=1 and 2 isomultiplets and isospin-mixing matrix elements\nin the excited states of 8Be. Finally, we present densities, momentum\ndistributions, and studies of the intrinsic shapes of these nuclei, with 8Be\nexhibiting a definite 2-alpha cluster structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2000 19:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
