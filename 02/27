This formulation is based on the asymptotic quantum measure,\nwhich is shown to be invariant under AET's. This invariance exposes an\nimportant connection between AET's and Feynman path integrals, and reveals the\nnonmetric character of the asymptotic quantum measure. The latter feature\nbecomes even clearer when the theory is formulated in terms of the\ncoordinate-free formalism of asymptotically Euclidean manifold, which do not\nhave a metric structure. This mathematical formalism suggests the following\nphysical interpretation: (i) Particles evolution is represented by trajectories\non an asymptotically Euclidean manifold; (ii) The metric and the law of motion\nare not defined a priori as fundamental entities, but they are properties of a\nparticular class of reference frames; (iii) The universe is considered as a\nprobability space in which the asymptotic quantum measure plays the role of a\nprobability measure. Points (ii) and (iii) are used to build the asymptotic\nmeasurement theory, which is shown to be consistent with traditional quantum\nmeasurement theory.
