Fitting analytical models for the radial variation in gas density and\ntemperature to X-ray spectral images from the ROSAT PSPC and ASCA GIS, we\nderive gas entropy profiles for 20 galaxy clusters and groups. Scaling these\nprofiles to coincide in the self-similar case, the lowest mass systems are\nfound to have higher scaled entropy profiles than more massive systems. This\nappears to be due to a baseline entropy of 70-140 h50^-1/3 keV cm^2, depending\non the extent to which shocks have been suppressed in low mass systems. The\nextra entropy may be present in all systems, but is detectable only in poor\nclusters, compared to the entropy generated by gravitational collapse. This\nexcess entropy appears to be distributed uniformly with radius outside the\ncentral cooling regions. We determine the energy associated with this entropy\nfloor, by studying the net reduction in binding energy of the gas in low mass\nsystems, and find that it corresponds to a preheating temperature of ~0.3 keV.\nSince the relationship between entropy and energy injection depends upon gas\ndensity, we can combine the excesses of 70-140 keV cm^2 and 0.3 keV to derive\nthe typical electron density of the gas into which the energy was injected. The\nresulting value of 1-3x10^-4 h50^1/2 cm-3, implies that the heating must have\nhappened prior to cluster collapse but after a redshift z~7-10.

The primary aim of this\nwork is to elucidate the star-formation history of this sub-class of elliptical\ngalaxies by tracing the cosmological evolution of dust mass. Using SCUBA on the\nJCMT we have obtained 850-micron photometry of 47 radio galaxies to a\nconsistent rms depth of 1 mJy, and have detected dust emission in 14 cases. The\nradio galaxy targets have been selected from a series of low-frequency radio\nsurveys of increasing depth (3CRR, 6CE, etc), in order to allow us to separate\nthe effects of increasing redshift and increasing radio power on submillimetre\nluminosity. Although the dynamic range of our study is inevitably small, we\nfind clear evidence that the typical submillimetre luminosity (and hence dust\nmass) of a powerful radio galaxy is a strongly increasing function of redshift;\nthe detection rate rises from 15 per cent at z < 2.5 to 75 per cent at z > 2.5,\nand the average submillimetre luminosity rises as (1+z)^3 out to z~4. Moreover\nour extensive sample allows us to argue that this behaviour is not driven by\nunderlying correlations with other radio galaxy properties such as radio power,\nradio spectral index, or radio source size/age. Although radio selection may\nintroduce other more subtle biases, the redshift distribution of our detected\nobjects is in fact consistent with the most recent estimates of the redshift\ndistribution of comparably bright submillimetre sources discovered in blank\nfield surveys. The evolution of submillimetre luminosity found here for radio\ngalaxies may thus be representative of massive ellipticals in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2000 19:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2000 20:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
