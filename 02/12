The main difference is that BHM is based on microcanonical,\nfixed-energy averages which depends only on the good statistics taken {\\bf\ninside} each energy level. The detailed distribution of visits among different\nenergy levels, determined by the particular dynamic rule one adopts, is\nirrelevant. Contrary to MUCA, where the results are extracted from the dynamic\nrule itself, within BHM any microcanonical dynamics could be adopted. As a\nnumerical test, we have used both BHM and MUCA in order to obtain the spectral\nenergy degeneracy of the Ising model in $4 \\times 4 \\times 4$ and $32 \\times\n32$ lattices, for which exact results are known. We discuss why BHM gives more\naccurate results than MUCA, even using {\\bf the same} Markovian sequence of\nstates. In addition, such advantage increases for larger systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2000 21:05:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Instead, the two complex conjugate poles go to a different\nlimit, what we call a ``pole on a pole''.

(``Weak'' means the\nradiation's amplitude is small enough that its own gravitation may be\nneglected.) Unfortunately, it is difficult to accurately compute solutions to\nthe separated radial equation (the Teukolsky equation), particularly in a\nnumerical implementation. The fundamental reason for this is that the Teukolsky\nequation's potentials are long ranged. For non-spinning black holes, one can\nget around this difficulty by applying transformations which relate the\nTeukolsky solution to solutions of the Regge-Wheeler equation, which has a\nshort-ranged potential. A particularly attractive generalization of this\napproach to spinning black holes for gravitational radiation (spin weight s =\n-2) was given by Sasaki and Nakamura.

For any positive integer h, the\nsumset hA is the set of all sums of h not necessarily distinct elements of A.\nWe define 0A = {0}. If A_1,...,A_r, and B are finite sumsets of A and\nh_1,...,h_r are nonnegative integers, the sumset h_1A + ... + h_rA_r + B is the\nset of all elements of S that can be represented in the form u_1 + ... + u_r +\nb, where u_i \\in h_iA_i and b \\in B. The growth function of this sumset is\n\\gamma(h_1,...,h_r) = |h_1A + ... + h_rA_r + B|. Applying the Hilbert function\nfor graded modules over graded algebras, where the grading is over the\nsemigroup of r-tuples of nonnegative integers, we prove that there is a\npolynomial p(t_1,...,t_r) such that \\gamma(h_1,...,h_r) = p(t_1,...,t_r) if\nmin(h_1,...,h_r) is sufficienlty large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2000 16:32:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Feb 2000 19:28:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-30"}
