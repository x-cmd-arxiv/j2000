We find that a significant fraction of\nthe sources optically classified as AGNs do not show any indication of nuclear\nactivity in the X rays, thus suggesting heavy absorption along our line of\nsight. The absence of strong emission in the 20-200 keV band in a subsample of\nLIGs observed with BeppoSAX suggests that in many cases these sources are\ncompletely Compton thick (N_H > 10^25 cm^(-2)). From a comparison between the\ninfrared and the X-ray emission we deduce that the mid-IR emission is absorbed\nby a lower column density than the X-ray emission or, alternatively, that the\ndust-to-gas ratio is lower than Galactic. We describe a simple model that\nreproduces the IR-X correlation by means of mixed AGN and starburst\ncontributions and we compare the predictions of this model with the\nobservational data at X-ray and optical wavelengths.

The results show that, except for the bin of\n$81^{\\circ}$-$90^{\\circ}$, in which the apparent minor isophotal diameters that\nare used to obtain the inclinations, are affected by the central bulges, the\ndistributions for Sa, Sab, Scd and Sd are well consistent with the Monte-Carlo\nsimulation of random inclinations within 3-$\\sigma$, and Sb and Sbc almost, but\nSc is different. One reason for the difference between the real distribution\nand the Monte-Carlo simulation of Sc may be that some quite inclined spirals,\nthe arms of which are inherently loosely wound on the galactic plane and should\nbe classified to Sc galaxies, have been incorrectly classified to the earlier\nones, because the tightness of spiral arms which is one of the criteria of the\nHubble classification in RC3 is different between on the galactic plane and on\nthe tangent plane of the celestial sphere. Our result also implies that there\nmight exist biases in the luminosity functions of individual Hubble types if\nspiral galaxies are only classified visually.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2000 08:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We employ the improved gauge\nactions which consist of plaquette and six-link rectangular loops, $c_0 P(1\n\\times 1)_{\\mu \\nu} + c_1 P(1 \\times 2)_{\\mu \\nu}$. This class of actions\ncovers Symanzik, Iwasaki and DBW2 actions. The ratio $\\eta$ shows an impressive\nbehavior as a function of $c_{1}$, i.e.,$\\eta>1$ for the standard Wilson and\nSymanzik actions, while $\\eta<1$ for Iwasaki and DBW2 actions. This is\nconfirmed non-perturbatively by numerical simulations in weak coupling regions.\nThe derivatives $\\partial g^{-2}_{\\tau}/\\partial \\xi$ and $\\partial\ng^{-2}_{\\sigma}/\\partial \\xi$ also changes sign as $-c_{1}$ increases. For\nIwasaki and DBW2 actions they become opposite sign to those for standard and\nSymanzik actions.

Linear waves\nin bounded geometries for which classical ray trajectories are chaotic are\nknown to give rise to scarred patterns. Here, we utilize parametrically forced\nsurface waves (Faraday waves), which become progressively nonlinear beyond the\nwave instability threshold, to investigate the subtle interplay between\nboundaries and nonlinearity. Only a subset (three main types) of the computed\nlinear modes of the stadium are observed in a systematic scan. These correspond\nto modes in which the wave amplitudes are strongly enhanced along paths\ncorresponding to certain periodic ray orbits. Many other modes are found to be\nsuppressed, in general agreement with a prediction by Agam and Altshuler based\non boundary dissipation and the Lyapunov exponent of the associated orbit.\nSpatially asymmetric or disordered (but time-independent) patterns are also\nfound even near onset. As the driving acceleration is increased, the\ntime-independent scarred patterns persist, but in some cases transitions\nbetween modes are noted. The onset of spatiotemporal chaos at higher forcing\namplitude often involves a nonperiodic oscillation between spatially ordered\nand disordered states. We characterize this phenomenon using the concept of\npattern entropy. The rate of change of the patterns is found to be reduced as\nthe state passes temporarily near the ordered configurations of lower entropy.\nWe also report complex but highly symmetric (time-independent) patterns far\nabove onset in the regime that is normally chaotic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2000 16:49:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2000 18:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
