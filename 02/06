Effects caused by a\nnon-Euclidean geometry of the physical phase space in quantum gauge models are\ndescribed in the operator and path integral formalisms. The projection on the\nDirac gauge invariant states is used to derive a necessary modification of the\nHamiltonian path integral in gauge theories of the Yang-Mills type with\nfermions that takes into account the non-Euclidean geometry of the physical\nphase space. The new path integral is applied to resolve the Gribov\nobstruction. Applications to the Kogut-Susskind lattice gauge theory are given.\nThe basic ideas are illustrated with examples accessible for non-specialists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Feb 2000 21:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These higher limits are\nof importance e.g., for the study of maps between classifying spaces as well as\nfor group cohomology.\n  We show that these higher limits can be identified with the G-equivariant\nBredon cohomology of the subgroup complex of p-subgroups in G (i.e., the nerve\nof the poset of p-subgroups in G) with values in a G-local coefficient system.\nWe examine when smaller complexes can be used e.g., taking only p-radical\nsubgroups, p-centric subgroups, elementary abelian p-subgroups or various\nsubcollections thereof.\n  Since the subgroup complexes are finite complexes, and often rather small,\nthis provides concrete, computable formulas for these higher limits,\ngeneralizing earlier work of especially Jackowski-McClure-Oliver.\n  As an application we look at the special case where all the higher limits\nvanish, as for example is the case for group cohomology. If F is a functor on\nthe orbit category our formulas for the higher limits in this case yield five\ndifferent expressions of F(G) in terms of values of F on proper subgroups.
