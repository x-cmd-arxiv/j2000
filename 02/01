Spectra, covering 3250-8790 A at a resolution of 1.6 A,\nwere obtained at the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) for cluster F and\nthe highly reddened cluster L. We compare the strengths of the observed Balmer\nabsorption lines and the Balmer jump in the blue spectrum of F with theoretical\nmodel cluster spectra using the PEGASE spectral synthesis code to derive an age\nof 60+/-20 Myr. For cluster L, we find that the similarities in the strength of\nthe Ca II triplet and overall spectral appearance with cluster F suggest a\nsimilar age. The brightness and compactness of cluster F make it an ideal\ncandidate for determining its dynamical mass by measuring the velocity\ndispersion. We present the results of such an investigation based on echelle\nspectra at a resolution of 8 km/s obtained at the WHT from 5760-9140 A. By\ncross-correlating various wavelength regions in the spectrum of cluster F with\ncool giant and supergiant template stars, we derive a velocity dispersion and,\nby application of the virial theorem, determine a dynamical mass of 2 million\nsolar masses. We compare our derived mass with those determined for other young\nsuper star clusters and discuss whether our derived parameters are consistent\nwith cluster F being able to survive to become a globular cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2000 17:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

FR I nuclei lie in the radio-optical\nluminosity plane along a tight linear correlation, which argues for a common\nsynchrotron origin. FR II show a more complex behavior, which is however\nclearly related to their optical spectral classification.\n  Broad line FR II radio galaxies (BLRG) are located overall well above the FR\nI correlation, suggesting that a contribution from thermal (disc) emission is\npresent. Three narrow line (NLRG) and one weak line radio galaxy (WLRG), in\nwhich no nuclear source is seen, can be interpreted as the obscured\ncounter-parts of BLRG, in agreement with the current unification schemes.\n  Conversely, in 5 sources of the sample, all of them NLRG or WLRG, optical\ncores are located on the same correlation defined by FR I and with similar\nradio and optical luminosities. This suggests that, in analogy to FR I, the\nemission is dominated by synchrotron radiation and represents the optical\ncounter-part of the non-thermal radio cores. Interestingly, all these galaxies\nare located in clusters, an environment typical of FR I.\n  These results imply that, at least at low redshifts, the FR II population is\nnot homogeneous. Furthermore, the traditional dichotomy between edge darkened\nand brightened radio morphology is not univocally connected with the innermost\nnuclear structure, as we find FR~II with FR I-like nuclei and this has\ninteresting bearings from the point of view of the AGN unified models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2000 12:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Near the band-center, the lattice model can be described by Dirac\nfermions with several species, each of which yields WZW term for an effective\naction of the Goldstone mode. The WZW terms cancel out each other because of\nthe four-fold symmetry of the model, which suggests that the quasiparticle\nstates are localized. If the lattice model has, however, symmetry breaking\nterms which generate mass for any species of the Dirac fermions, remaining WZW\nterm which avoids the cancellation can derive the system to a delocalized\nstrong-coupling fixed point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2000 04:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Our computational methodology is based upon a\nfinite-element moving least-squares method (MWLS) presented recently by Wyatt\nand co-workers (Lopreore and Wyatt, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 82}, 5190 (1999)).\nThis method treats the \"particles\" in the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation as\nLagrangian fluid elements which carry the phase, $S$, and density,\n  $\\rho$, required to reconstruct the quantum wavefunctions. Here, we compare\nresults obtained via the MWLS procedure to exact results obtained either\nanalytically or by numerical solution of the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. Two systems are considered: firstly, dynamics in a harmonic well and\nsecondly tunneling dynamics in a double well potential. In the case of\ntunneling in the double well potential, the quantum potential acts to lower the\nbarrier separating the right and left hand sides of the well permitting\ntrajectories to pass from one side to another.\n  However, as probability density passes from one side to the other, the\neffective barrier begins to rise and eventually will segregate trajectories in\none side from the other. We note that the MWLS trajectories exhibited long time\nstability in the purely harmonic cases. However, this stability was not evident\nin the barrier crossing dynamics. Comparisons to exact trajectories obtained\nvia wave packet calculations indicate that the MWLS trajectories tend to\nunderestimate the effects of constructive and destructive interference effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2000 23:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2000 23:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
