This\nnotion is developed in terms of trees and branches on Banach spaces. Every\ncountably infinite countably branching tree $\\mathcal T$ of a certain type on a\nspace X is presumed to have a branch with some property. It is shown that then\nX can be embedded into a space with an FDD $(E_i)$ so that all normalized\nsequences in X which are almost a skipped blocking of $(E_i)$ have that\nproperty. As an application of our work we prove that if X is a separable\nreflexive Banach space and for some $1<p<\\infty$ and $C<\\infty$ every weakly\nnull tree $\\mathcal T$ on the sphere of X has a branch C-equivalent to the unit\nvector basis of $\\ell_p$, then for all $\\epsilon>0$, there exists a finite\ncodimensional subspace of X which $C^2+\\epsilon$ embeds into the $\\ell_p$ sum\nof finite dimensional spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Feb 2000 19:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

If the parts are independently coded,\nmultiple simultaneous mutations appear necessary to create or modify these\nsystems. It is generally believed that most proteins are independently coded.\nThe textbook rule is one gene for one enzyme. Thus, biochemical systems with\ntightly coadapted parts such as the blood clotting cascade pose a difficulty\nfor Darwinian evolution. This problem can be overcome if the current\nunderstanding of the genetic code is incomplete and a system-level genetic code\nin which seemingly independent proteins are encoded in an interdependent,\nhighly correlated manner exists. The methods by which human beings design and\nfabricate complex systems of tightly coadapted parts are explored for insights\ninto the requirements for a system-level genetic code. Detailed examples of\nsystem-level codes for networks of matching parts are presented.
