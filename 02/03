Nearly\nall astrophysical signals have noiselike statistics of this type, many with\nimportant spectral variations. The noise is digitized and correlated to form a\nmeasured correlation function, which is then Fourier transformed to produce a\nmeasured spectrum. When averaged over many samples, the elements of the\ncorrelation function and of the spectrum, follow Gaussian distributions.

This process is essential for understanding a wide\nvariety of astrophysical processes, including stellar and galactic dynamos and\nastrophysical turbulence. To account for solar flares, solar cycles and the\nstructure of the galactic magnetic field reconnection must be fast, propagating\nwith a speed close to the Alfven speed. We show that the presence of a random\nmagnetic field component substantially enhances the reconnection rate and\nenables fast reconnection, i.e. reconnection that does not depend on fluid\nresistivity. The enhancement of the reconnection rate is achieved via a\ncombination of two effects. First of all, only small segments of magnetic field\nlines are subject to direct Ohmic annihilation. Thus the fraction of magnetic\nenergy that goes directly into fluid heating goes to zero as fluid resistivity\nvanishes. However, the most important enhancement comes from the fact that\nunlike the laminar fluid case where reconnection is constrained to proceed line\nby line, the presence of turbulence enables many magnetic field lines to enter\nthe reconnection zone simultaneously. A significant fraction of magnetic energy\ngoes into MHD turbulence and this enhances reconnection rates through an\nincrease in the field stochasticity. In this way magnetic reconnection becomes\nfast when field stochasticity is accounted for. As a consequence solar and\ngalactic dynamos are also fast, i.e. do not depend on fluid resistivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2000 02:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

This strong anisotropy is discussed in view of a\npseudo-gap formation, of which crucial ingredients are the exchange splitting\nof U 5f states and their hybridization with chalcogen p states (f-p\nhybridization). An anomalous trend in the anisotropy is found in the series\n(US>>USe<UTe) and interpreted in terms of competition between localization of\nthe U 5f states and the f-p hybridization. It is the spin-orbit interaction on\nthe chalcogen p states that plays an essential role in enlarging the strength\nof the f-p hybridization in UTe, leading to an anomalous systematic trend in\nthe magnetic anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2000 00:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
