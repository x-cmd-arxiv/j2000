A comparison of our predicted\nabundances of C, N, O and Si in the case of a burst occurring in a primordial\ngas shows a very good agreement with the observed abundances in IZw18 as long\nas the burst has an age of $\\sim 31$ Myr and IMS produce some primary nitrogen.\nHowever, we cannot exclude that a previous burst of star formation had occurred\nin IZw18 especially if the preenrichment produced by the older burst was lower\nthan $Z=0.01$ Z$_{\\odot}$. Finally, at variance with previous studies, we find\nthat most of the metals reside in the cold gas phase already after few Myr.\nThis result is mainly due to the assumed low SNII heating efficiency, and\njustifies the generally adopted homogeneous and instantaneous mixing of gas in\nchemical evolution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2000 13:10:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2000 16:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In contrast to a crossover without\nthermodynamic anomaly found in a dilute system, we show the existence of a\nquantum phase transition near half filling. The transition is driven by charge\ndensity waves instabilities. We have found that superconductivity and charge\ndensity waves coexist in the presence of a weak intersite repulsion. The ground\nstate phase diagram is determined and the quantum phase transition is an\nattractive version of the Mott transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2000 10:44:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2000 06:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In particular, we discuss the role of Auger electrons in the\nelectron dynamics and its dependence on the d-hole lifetime, the optical\ntransition matrix elements and the laser pulse duration. We find that the Auger\ncontribution to the distribution is very sensitive to both the d-hole lifetime\ntau_h and the laser pulse duration tau_l and can be expressed as a monotonic\nfunction of tau_l/tau_h. We have found that for a given tau_h, the Auger\ncontribution is significantly smaller for a short pulse duration than for a\nlonger one. We show that the relaxation time at the peak depends linearly on\nthe d-hole lifetime, but interestingly not on the amount of Auger electrons\ngenerated. We provide a simple expression for the relaxation time of excited\nelectrons which shows that its shape can be understood by a phase space\nargument and its amplitude is governed by the d-hole lifetime.

They are stated at the\n(abstract) C*-level and can therefore be considered as a refinement of the\nextension results given for von Neumann algebras for example by Jones\n[Mem.Am.Math.Soc. 28 Nr 237 (1980)] or Sutherland [Publ.Res.Inst.Math.Sci. 16\n(1980) 135]. A Hilbert extension exists iff there is a generalized 2-cocycle.\nThese results generalize those in [Commun.Math.Phys. 15 (1969) 173], which are\nformulated in the context of superselection theory, where it is assumed that\nthe algebra $A$ has a trivial center, i.e. $Z=C1$. In particular the well-known\n``outer characterization'' of the second cohomology $H^2(X,{\\cal\nU}(Z),\\alpha_X)$ can be reformulated: there is a bijection to the set of all\n$A$-module isomorphy classes of Hilbert extensions. Finally, a Hilbert space\nrepresentation (due to Sutherland in the von Neumann case) is mentioned. The\nC*-norm of the Hilbert extension is expressed in terms of the norm of this\nrepresentation and it is linked to the so-called regular representation\nappearing in superselection theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2000 15:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The key to our analysis is that alpha-induction produces half-braidings\nin the sense of Izumi, so that his general theory can be applied. Nevertheless,\nalpha-induced systems are in general not braided, and thus our results allow to\ncompute the quantum doubles of (certain) systems without braiding. We\nillustrate our general results by several examples, including the computation\nof the quantum double systems for the asymptotic inclusion of the E_8 subfactor\nas well as its three analogues arising from conformal inclusions of SU(3)_k.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2000 15:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The pion directed flow has negative slope\nin the midrapidity range irrespective of bombarding energy and mass number of\nthe colliding ions. In contrast, the directed flow of nucleons vanishes and\neven develops antiflow in the midrapidity range in (semi)peripheral collisions\nat energies around 11.6 A GeV and higher. The origin of the disappearance of\nflow is linked to nuclear shadowing. Since the effect is stronger for a light\nsystem, it can be distinguished from the similar phenomenon caused by the\nquark-gluon plasma formation. In the latter case the disappearance of the flow\ndue to the softening of the equation of state should be most pronounced in\ncollisions of heavy ions. The centrality dependence of the elliptic flow shows\nthat the maximum in the <v_2(b)> distribution is shifted to very peripheral\nevents with rising incident energy, in accord with experimental data.
