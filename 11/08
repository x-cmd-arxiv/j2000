The QE method exploits the fact\nthat the the gravitational radiation inspiral timescale is much longer than the\norbital period everywhere outside the ISCO. Here we demonstrate the validity\nand advantages of the QE scheme by solving a model problem in relativistic\nscalar gravitation theory. By adopting scalar gravitation, we are able to\nnumerically track without approximation the damping of a simple, quasi-periodic\nradiating system (an oscillating spherical matter shell) to final equilibrium,\nand then use the exact numerical results to calibrate the QE approximation\nmethod. In particular, we calculate the emitted gravitational wavetrain three\ndifferent ways: by integrating the exact coupled dynamical field and matter\nequations, by using the scalar-wave monopole approximation formula\n(corresponding to the quadrupole formula in general relativity), and by\nadopting the QE scheme. We find that the monopole formula works well for weak\nfield cases, but fails when the fields become even moderately strong. By\ncontrast, the QE scheme remains quite reliable for moderately strong fields,\nand begins to breakdown only for ultra-strong fields. The QE scheme thus\nprovides a promising technique to construct the complete wavetrain from binary\ninspiral outside the ISCO, where the gravitational fields are strong, but where\nthe computational resources required to follow the system for more than a few\norbits by direct numerical integration of the exact equations are prohibitive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2000 22:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

However, like all exponential growth laws, there are physical\nlimits to be considered. The nonlinear nature of the propagation of light in\noptical fiber has made these limits difficult to elucidate. Here we obtain\nbasic insights into the limits to the information capacity of an optical fiber\narising from these nonlinearities. The key simplification lies in relating the\nnonlinear channel to a linear channel with multiplicative noise, for which we\nare able to obtain analytical results. In fundamental distinction to the linear\nadditive noise case, the capacity does not grow indefinitely with increasing\nsignal power, but has a maximal value. The ideas presented here have broader\nimplications for other nonlinear information channels, such as those involved\nin sensory transduction in neurobiology. These have been often examined using\nadditive noise linear channel models, and as we show here, nonlinearities can\nchange the picture qualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2000 19:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
