The supernova-like\noutburst that accompanies some gamma-ray bursts suggest that some long-duration\nGRBs may be driven by the accretion of a rotating stellar core onto a central\nblack hole. Such a system can be produced when a compact remnant spirals into\nthe helium core of its binary companion. During the inspiral, orbital angular\nmomentum is injected into the core. By the time the compact remnant reaches the\ncenter of the helium core, it too has gained angular momentum as well as mass,\nproducing a rapidly accreting black hole (or neutron star) at the center of a\nrotating stellar core. In this paper, we use a 3-dimensional smooth particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) code to follow such a merger process and make quantitative\nestimates of the initial mass and spin of the central compact remnant, as well\nas the angular momentum in the accreting helium core.

Then, in this paper, we present a convenient\nanalytical formula including this effect. In order to obtain the dependence on\nthe dust-to-gas ratio, we extend the formula derived in our previous paper, in\nwhich a theoretical formula converting IR luminosity to SFR was derived.

Due to\nthe lack of information about both the source distance and its emission\nspectrum, the results of the search are expressed in terms of upper limits, at\nthe Earth, to the antineutrino flux $\\cdot$ cross-section, integrated over\ndifferent time durations. Moreover, assuming thermal antineutrino spectra at\nthe source, upper limits to the antineutrino flux, integrated over time\nduration, for different spectral temperatures, are obtained. Based on these\nlimits and on the expectations for neutrino emission from collapsing\nastrophysical objects, the occurrence of a gravitational stellar collapse can\nbe excluded up to a distance r approximately 50 kpc, in the case of time\ncoincidence with GRB990705, and r approximately 20 kpc, for the 24 hours\npreceding it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2000 15:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

Preheating is the exponentially rapid transfer of energy from the\nnearly homogeneous inflaton field to fluctuations of other fields and/or the\ninflaton itself. This rapid transfer leaves these fields in a highly nonthermal\nstate with energy concentrated in infrared modes. We have performed lattice\nsimulations of the evolution of interacting scalar fields during and after\npreheating for a variety of inflationary models. We have formulated a set of\ngeneric rules that govern the thermalization process in all of these models.\nNotably, we see that once one of the fields is amplified through parametric\nresonance or other mechanisms it rapidly excites other coupled fields to\nexponentially large occupation numbers. These fields quickly acquire nearly\nthermal spectra in the infrared, which gradually propagates into higher\nmomenta. Prior to the formation of total equilibrium, the excited fields group\ninto subsets with almost identical characteristics (e.g. group effective\ntemperature). The way fields form into these groups and the properties of the\ngroups depend on the couplings between them.

In contrast the nonlocal\nscenario changes the energy transferred during collisions and leads to an\nenhancement of mid-rapidity matter. The renormalisation of quasiparticle\nenergies can be included in nonlocal scenarios and leads to a further\nenhancement of mid-rapidity matter distribution.

First, the short term behavior of expectation value\nof a quantity on an equally weighted wave packet (EWWP) is in classical limit\nproved to reproduce the Fej'{e}r average of the Fourier series decomposition of\nthe corresponding classical quantity. Second, in order to best mimic the\nclassical behavior, a nice relation between number $N$ of stationary states in\nthe EWWP with the average quantum number $n$ as $N\\thickapprox \\sqrt{n}$ is\nrevealed. Third, since the Fej\\'{e}r average can only approximate the classical\nquantity, it carries an uncertainty which in large quantum number case is\nalmost the same as the quantum uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2000 09:34:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
