This example shows that traditional homological algebra is\nencompassed by Quillen's homotopical algebra. The goal of this paper is to show\nthat more general forms of homological algebra also fit into Quillen's\nframework. Specifically, a projective class on a complete and cocomplete\nabelian category A is exactly the information needed to do homological algebra\nin A. The main result is that, under weak hypotheses, the category of chain\ncomplexes of objects of A has a model category structure that reflects the\nhomological algebra of the projective class in the sense that it encodes the\nExt groups and more general derived functors. Examples include the \"pure\nderived category\" of a ring R, and derived categories capturing relative\nsituations, including the projective class for Hochschild homology and\ncohomology. We characterize the model structures that are cofibrantly\ngenerated, and show that this fails for many interesting examples.
