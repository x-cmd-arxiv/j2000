We\npresent simulations of such a survey using a 1-2m aperture space telescope with\na ~2 square degree field-of-view which is used to continuously monitor ~10^8\nGalactic bulge main sequence stars. The microlensing techniques allows the\ndiscovery of low mass planets with high signal-to-noise, and the space mission\nthat we have studied are sensitive to planets with masses as low as that of\nMars. By targeting main sequence source stars, which can only be resolved from\nspace, the space-based microlensing survey is able to detect enough light from\nthe lens stars to determine the spectral type of one third of the lens stars\nwith detected planets, including virtually all of the F, G, and K stars which\ncomprise one quarter of the event sample. This enables the determination of the\nplanetary masses and separations in physical units, as well as the abundance of\nplanets as a function of stellar type and distance from the Galactic center. We\nshow that a space-based microlensing planet search program has its highest\nsensitivity to planets at orbital separations of 0.7-10 AU, but it will also\nhave significant sensitivity at larger separations and will be able to detect\nfree-floating planets in significant numbers. This complements the planned\nterrestrial planet transit missions which are sensitive to terrestrial planets\nat separations of =< 1 AU. Such a mission also detect ~50,000 giant planets via\ntransits, and it is, therefore, the only proposed planet detection method that\nis sensitive to planets at all orbital radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2000 23:48:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2000 17:34:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2002 20:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Moreover,\nwe include, for the first time in models by our group, the effects of modern\nrates for beta-decay in addition to electron capture and positron emission.\nValues for the central electron mole number at the time of iron core collapse\nin the new models are typically larger, by delta Y_e = 0.005 to 0.015, than\nthose of Woosley & Weaver 1995, with a tendency for the more massive models to\ndisplay larger differences. About half of this change is a consequence of\nincluding beta-decay; the other half, result of the smaller rates for electron\ncapture. Unlike what might be expected solely on basis of the larger Y_e's, the\nnew iron core masses are systematically smaller owing to a decrease in the\nentropy in the outer iron core. The changes in iron core mass range from zero\nto 0.1 M_sun. We also observe, as predicted by Aufderheide et al. (1994), a\ntendency towards beta-equilibrium just prior to the collapse of the core, and\nthe subsequent loss of that equilibrium as core collapse proceeds. We discuss\nthe key weak reaction rates, both beta-decay and electron-capture, responsible\nfor the evolution of Y_e and make suggestions for future measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2000 00:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The result of a reduction in the rewriting calculus is\neither an empty set representing the application failure, or a singleton\nrepresenting a deterministic result, or a set having several elements\nrepresenting a not-deterministic choice of results.\n  In this thesis we concentrate on the properties of the rewriting calculus\nwhere a syntactic matching is used in order to bind the variables to their\ncurrent values. We define evaluation strategies ensuring the confluence of the\ncalculus and we show that these strategies become trivial for restrictions of\nthe general rewriting calculus to simpler calculi like the lambda-calculus. The\nrewriting calculus is not terminating in the untyped case but the strong\nnormalization is obtained for the simply typed calculus.\n  In the rewriting calculus extended with an operator allowing to test the\napplication failure we define terms representing innermost and outermost\nnormalizations with respect to a set of rewriting rules. By using these terms,\nwe obtain a natural and concise description of the conditional rewriting.\nFinally, starting from the representation of the conditional rewriting rules,\nwe show how the rewriting calculus can be used to give a semantics to ELAN, a\nlanguage based on the application of rewriting rules controlled by strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2000 15:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is shown, in agreement with Bell's\ntheorem, that the most general local hidden-variable model fails in reproducing\nthe whole set of quantum-mechanical joint probabilities. We achieve these\nconclusion by employing two different approaches. In a first one the local\nrealistic observables are deduced from the most general premises concerning\nlocality and realism, and Bell-like inequalities are not employed. The other\napproach makes use of Bell's inequalities. Within the former scheme, under\nparticular conditions for the detection times, the discrepancy between quantum\nmechanics and local realism for the time-dependent asymmetry turns out to be\nnot less than 20%. The same incompatibility can be made evident by means of a\nBell-type test by employing both Wigner's and (once properly normalized\nprobabilities are used) Clauser-Holt-Shimony-Holt's inequalities. Because of\nthe relatively low experimental accuracy, the data obtained by the CPLEAR\ncollaboration for the asymmetry parameter do not allow for a decisive test of\nlocal realism. Such a test, both with and without the use of Bell's\ninequalities, should be feasible in the future at the Frascati $\\Phi$-factory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2000 19:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
