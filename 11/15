The bulge and disk parameters have\nbeen estimated using a seeing convolved Sersic r^(1/n) bulge and a seeing\nconvolved exponential disk. In general, early-type spiral galaxy bulges have\nSersic values of n>1, and late-type spiral galaxy bulges have values of n<1. In\nthe B-band, only 8 galaxies have a bulge shape parameter n consistent with the\nexponential value of 1, and only 5 galaxies do in the K-band. Application of\nthe r^(1/n) bulge models results in a larger mean r_e/h ratio for the\nearly-type spiral galaxies than the late-type spiral galaxies. Although, this\nresult is shown not to be statistically significant. The mean B/D luminosity\nratio is, however, significantly larger (> 3-sigma) for the early-type spirals\nthan the late-type spirals. This apparent contradiction with the r_e/h values\ncan be explained with an iceberg-like scenario, in which the bulges in\nlate-type spiral galaxies are relatively submerged in their disk. This can be\nachieved by varying the relative bulge/disk stellar density while maintaining\nthe same effective bulge-to-disk size ratio.\n  The absolute bulge magnitude - log(n) diagram is used as a diagnostic tool\nfor comparative studies with dwarf elliptical and ordinary elliptical galaxies.\nAt least in the B-band, these objects occupy distinctly different regions of\nthis parameter space. While the dwarf ellipticals appear to be the faint\nextension to the brighter elliptical galaxies, the bulges of spiral galaxies\nare not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2000 16:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-04-26"}

Such exponents govern the rate of decay of anisotropy with decreasing\nscales. It is a fundamental question whether they ever increase as $\\ell$\nincreases, or they are bounded from above. The equations of motion in systems\nwith pressure contain nonlocal integrals over all space. One could argue that\nthe requirement of convergence of these integrals bounds the exponents from\nabove. It is shown here on the basis of a solvable model (the ``linear pressure\nmodel\"), that this is not necessarily the case. The model introduced here is of\na passive vector advection by a rapidly varying velocity field. The advected\nvector field is divergent free and the equation contains a pressure term that\nmaintains this condition. The zero modes of the second-order correlation\nfunction are found in all the sectors of the symmetry group.

The basis sets are of cc-pVTZ and\ncc-pVQZ quality, and have been optimized for use with the large-core\n(valence-electrons only) Stuttgart-Dresden-Bonn relativistic pseudopotentials.\nValidation calculations on a variety of third-row and fourth-row diatomics\nsuggest them to be comparable in quality to the all-electron cc-pVTZ and\ncc-pVQZ basis sets for lighter elements. Especially the SDB-cc-pVQZ basis set\nin conjunction with a core polarization potential (CPP) yields excellent\nagreement with experiment for compounds of the later heavy p-block elements.\nFor accurate calculations on Ga (and, to a lesser extent, Ge) compounds,\nexplicit treatment of 13 valence electrons appears to be desirable, while it\nseems inevitable for In compounds. For Ga and Ge, we propose correlation\nconsistent basis sets extended for (3d) correlation. For accurate calculations\non organometallic complexes of interest to homogenous catalysis, we recommend a\ncombination of the standard cc-pVTZ basis set for first- and second-row\nelements, the presently derived SDB-cc-pVTZ basis set for heavier p-block\nelements, and for transition metals, the small-core [6s5p3d] Stuttgart-Dresden\nbasis set-RECP combination supplemented by (2f1g) functions with exponents\ngiven in the Appendix to the present paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2000 10:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Specifically, in\nthis approach dimensionless ratios E(rho) / E(sigma) of entanglement measures\nmay depend on what state is chosen as the basic unit of entanglement. This\nobservation leads us to suggest three novel approaches to the quantification of\nentanglement. These approaches lead to unit-free definitions for the\nentanglement of formation and the distillable entanglement, and suggest natural\nmeasures of entanglement for multipartite systems. We also show that the\nbehaviour of one of these novel measures, the entanglement of computation, is\nrelated to some open problems in computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2000 05:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
