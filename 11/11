The absolute proper motion of Pal 13 with\nrespect to the background galaxies, derived from moderate scale photographic\nplates separated by a 40-year baseline, is $(\\mu_{\\alpha cos \\delta},\n\\mu_{\\delta}) = (+2.30, +0.27) \\pm (0.26, 0.25)$ milliarc-seconds per year. The\nresultant total space velocity (315 km s$^{-1}$) implies that Pal 13 is in the\ninner part of its orbit near perigalacticon. Orbital integration reveals the\ncluster to possess an inclined, very eccentric, retrograde orbit. These data\nconfirm that Pal 13 is a paradigm \"young halo\" globular cluster.\n  The derived proper motions for cluster stars are used to produce membership\nprobabilities and a cleaned CCD UBV catalogue for Pal 13. With this data set we\nhave made small revisions to Pal 13's distance, metallicity, position and light\nprofile. The membership of four previously reported RR Lyrae variables and a\nproportionally large group of blue straggler stars are confirmed. As expected,\nthe blue stragglers are centrally concentrated.\n  The small size of this cluster, combined with the shape of its light profile,\nwhich shows a clear departure from a classical King function beyond the tidal\nradius, suggests that Pal 13 is in the final throes of destruction. This could\nexplain the large blue straggler specific frequency, as destructive processes\nwould preferentially strip less massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2000 16:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Most generally, the evolution of an open\nquantum system is described by a completely positive linear map. We show how to\nderive a completely positive Markovian master equation (the Lindblad equation)\nfrom such a map by a coarse graining procedure. We provide a novel and explicit\nrecipe for calculating the coefficients of the master equation, using\nperturbation theory in the weak-coupling limit. The only parameter external to\nour theory is the coarse-graining time-scale. We illustrate the method by\nexplicitly deriving the master equation for the spin-boson model. The results\nare evaluated for the exactly solvable case of pure dephasing, and an excellent\nagreement is found within the timescale where the Markovian approximation is\nexpected to be valid. The method can be extended in principle to include\nnon-Markovian effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2000 05:20:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2001 19:32:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

This\ndifferentiable cohomology maps both to the cohomology of the group made\ndiscrete and to Lie algebra cohomology. We show that the secondary\ncharacteristic classes of Beilinson lead to differentiable cohomology classes\nwith coefficients in C*. These may be viewed as an enrichment of the\nChern-Simons differential forms.\n  By transgression, classes in differentiable cohomology of a Lie group G lead\nto differentiable cohomology classes for gauge groups Map(M,G). These classes\ngeneralize the central extensions of loop groups. We also discuss holomorphic\ncohomology of complex Lie groups as the natural place to construct secondary\nclasses.\n  We present several conjectures relating the above cohomology classes to the\ndifferential forms of Bott-Shulman-Stasheff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2000 02:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is well known that, when applying\nthese approximations, complex predecessors of orbits created in the bifurcation\n(``ghost orbits'') can produce clear signatures in the semiclassical spectra.\nWe demonstrate that these orbits themselves can undergo bifurcations, resulting\nin complex, non-generic bifurcation scenarios. We do so by studying an example\ntaken from the Diamagnetic Kepler Problem. By application of normal form\ntheory, we construct an analytic description of the complete bifurcation\nscenario, which is then used to calculate the pertinent uniform approximation.\nThe ghost orbit bifurcation turns out to produce signatures in the\nsemiclassical spectrum in much the same way as a bifurcation of real orbits\nwould.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2000 16:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
