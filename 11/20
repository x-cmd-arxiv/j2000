All six of\nthe NLS1s we considered show evidence for a broad Fe Kalpha line, but none of\nthe line centroids are consistent with emission from highly ionised Fe.

The result of\nour gauge fixing is a constraint-free model whose phase space has four\nfield-like degrees of freedom and that depends on three constant parameters.\nTwo of these constants determine the global angular momentum and the linear\nmomentum in the axis direction, while the third parameter is related with the\nbehavior of the metric around the axis. We derive the explicit expression of\nthe metric in terms of the physical degrees of freedom, calculate the reduced\nequations of motion and obtain the Hamiltonian that generates the reduced\ndynamics.

This\nrealization is expected to open a new field of investigations on the\npersistence of the validity of the standard quantum theory for systems of\nincreasing complexity, in a quasi decoherence-free environment. Because of its\nnonlocal structure the new system is expected to play a relevant role in the\nmodern endeavor on quantum information and in the basic physics of\nentanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2000 09:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Experiments show both that this result is\ncorrect when the experiment does indeed consist of a series of measurements,\nand that it is not when the experiment consists of a period of observation:\nquantum jumps do happen. The possibilities for improving the formalism by\nincorporating transitions in the basic postulates are reviewed, and a\nsatisfactory postulate is obtained by modifying a suggestion of Bell's. This\nrequires a distinction between the external description of the whole of a\nphysical system and internal descriptions which are themselves physical events\nin the system. It is shown that this gives correct results for simple unstable\nsystems and for the quantum-jump experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2000 11:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
