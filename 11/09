This apparent discrepancy can be avoided if the universe has a\nnon-standard ionization history in which the recombination of hydrogen is\nsignificantly delayed relative to the standard model. While future CMB\nobservations may eliminate this discrepancy, it is useful to develop a general\nframework for analyzing non-standard ionization histories. We develop such a\nframework, examining non-standard models in which the hydrogen binding energy\nE_b and the overall expression for the time rate of change of the ionized\nfraction of electrons are multiplied by arbitrary factors.

We find a\nwide range of models with delayed recombination that are able to fit the CMB\ndata with a baryon density in accordance with BBN, but there are even allowed\nmodels with earlier recombination than in the standard model. A generic\nprediction of these models is that the third acoustic CMB peak should be very\nlow relative to what is found in the standard model. This is the case even for\nthe models with earlier recombination than in the standard model, because here\nthe third peak is lowered by an increased diffusion damping at recombination\nrelative to the standard model.

Taking a variety of considerations into\naccount we argue for K giants as the best type of stars for the grid, mainly\nbecause they can be located at much larger distances than any other type of\nstar due to their intrinsic brightness. We show that it is possible to identify\nsuitable candidate grid K giants from existing astrometric catalogs. However,\ndouble stars have to be eliminated from these candidate grid samples, since\nthey generally produce much larger astrometric jitter than tolerable for the\ngrid. The most efficient way to achieve this is probably by means of a radial\nvelocity survey. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we repeatedly\nmeasured the radial velocities for a pre-selected sample of 86 nearby Hipparcos\nK giants with precisions of 5-8 m/s. The distribution of the intrinsic radial\nvelocity variations for the bona-fide single K giants shows a maximum around 20\nm/s, which is small enough not to severely affect the identification of stellar\ncompanions around other K giants. We use the results of our observations as\ninput parameters for Monte-Carlo simulations on the possible design of a radial\nvelocity survey of all grid stars. Our favored scenario would result in a grid\nwhich consists to 68% of true single stars and to 32% of double or multiple\nstars with periods mostly larger than 200 years, but only 3.6% of all grid\nstars would display astrometric jitter larger than 1 microarcsecond.

For\nuniform-density fluids with standard Newtonian viscous terms, taking the\ndivergence of the equation of motion leaves a Poisson equation for the pressure\nto be solved. But Poisson equations require boundary conditions. For the case\nof rectangular periodic boundary conditions, pressures determined in this way\nare unambiguous. But in the presence of \"no-slip\" rigid walls, the equation of\nmotion can be used to infer both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on\nthe pressure P, and thus amounts to an over-determination. This has\noccasionally been recognized as a problem, and numerical treatments of\nwall-bounded shear flows usually have built in some relatively ad hoc dynamical\nrecipe for dealing with it, often one which appears to \"work\" satisfactorily.\nHere we consider a class of solenoidal velocity fields which vanish at no-slip\nwalls, have all spatial derivatives, but are simple enough that explicit\nanalytical solutions for P can be given. Satisfying the two boundary conditions\nseparately gives two pressures, a \"Neumann pressure\" and a \"Dirichlet pressure\"\nwhich differ non-trivially at the initial instant, even before any dynamics are\nimplemented. We compare the two pressures, and find that in particular, they\nlead to different volume forces near the walls.
