In this model a possible clue to the solution of the\nSNP's is in the reduction of the solar neutrino fluxes relative to the\npredicted by the Standard Solar Model through the decrease of the solar core\ntemperature. The former can be realized through the enhancement of the\nastrophysical factor for the solar proton burning. The enhancement the upper\nbound of which is restricted by the helioseismological data goes dynamically\nvia the contribution of the nucleon tensor current coupled to the deuteron. The\nagreement of the reduced solar neutrino fluxes with the experimental data can\nbe reached within a scenario of vacuum two-flavour neutrino oscillations\nwithout a fine tuning of the neutrino-flavour oscillation parameters. In the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model of light nuclei an enhancement of the astrophysical\nfactor for the solar proton burning entails a change of the cross sections for\nneutrino and anti-neutrino disintegration of the deuteron at low energies. This\nprovides a theoretical foundation for a new check of a value of the\nastrophysical factor in terrestrial laboratories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2000 16:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The observing technique requires that the\ntelescope is nodded rapidly between targets and adjacent sky positions; object\nand sky spectra are recorded on adjacent regions of a low-noise CCD through\ncharge shuffling. This permits the use of extremely high densities of small\nslit apertures (`microslits') since an extended slit is not required for sky\ninterpolation. The overall multi-object advantage of this technique is as large\nas 2.9x that of conventional multi-slit observing for an instrument\nconfiguration which has an underfilled CCD detector and is always >1.5 for high\ntarget densities. The `nod-shuffle' technique has been practically implemented\nat the Anglo-Australian Telescope as the `LDSS++ project' and achieves\nsky-subtraction accuracies as good as 0.04%, with even better performance\npossible. This is a factor of ten better than is routinely achieved with\nlong-slits. LDSS++ has been used in various observational modes, which we\ndescribe, and for a wide variety of astronomical projects. The nod-shuffle\napproach should be of great benefit to most spectroscopic (e.g. long-slit,\nfiber, integral field) methods and would allow much deeper spectroscopy on very\nlarge telescopes (10m or greater) than is currently possible. Finally we\ndiscuss the prospects of using nod-shuffle to pursue extremely long\nspectroscopic exposures (many days) and of mimicking nod-shuffle observations\nwith infrared arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2000 18:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-10"}

In this paper, we report on several\npieces of evidence that a large fraction of the [O III]4363 emission arises\nfrom the dense gas obscured by putative tori: (1) the visibility of high-R_OIII\nregions is correlated to that of broad-line regions, (2) higher-R_OIII objects\nshow hotter mid-infrared colors, (3) higher-R_OIII objects show stronger\nhighly-ionized emission lines such as [Fe VII]6087 and [Fe X]6374, and (4)\nhigher-R_OIII objects have broader line width of [O III]4363 normalized by that\nof [O III]5007. To estimate how such a dense component contributes to the total\nemission-line flux, dual-component photoionization model calculations are\nperformed. It is shown that the observed values of R_OIII of type 1 AGNs may be\nexplained by introducing a 5% - 20% contribution from the dense component while\nthose of type 2 AGNs may be explained by introducing a 0% - 2% contribution.

In [Sz5] the considerations are completely concluded in\nthe ball-case and in the nilpotent-case. The other cases were mostly outlined.\nIn this paper the isospectrality theorems are completely established on\nspheres. Also the important details required about the solvable extensions are\nconcluded in this paper.\n  A new so called anticommutator technique is developed for these\nconstructions. This tool is completely different from the other methods applied\nin the field so far. It brought a wide range of new isospectrality examples.\nThose constructed on geodesic spheres of certain harmonic manifolds are\nparticularly striking. One of these spheres is homogeneous (since it is the\ngeodesic sphere of a 2-point homogeneous space) while the other spheres,\nalthough isospectral to the previous one, are not even locally homogeneous.\nThis shows how little information is encoded about the geometry (for instance,\nabout the isometries) in the spectrum of Laplacian acting on functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2000 00:42:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Mar 2003 00:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
