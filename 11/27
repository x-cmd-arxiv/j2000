The results for all models we consider show qualitative similarities,\nbut also significant temperature shifts from model to model of peaks and other\nfeatures in the specific-heat curves. The use of phenomenological\npseudopotentials shifts the melting peak substantially (~ 50--100 K) when\ncompared to ab-initio results. It is argued that the choice of a good\npseudopotential and use of better electronic kinetic-energy functionals has the\npotential for performing large time scale and large sized thermodynamical\nsimulations on clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2000 07:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

The uniform approximation used here relies upon the fact that by\npassing into Fourier space the Mathieu equation can be mapped onto the simpler\nproblem of a double well potential. The resulting eigenfunctions (Bloch waves),\nwhich are uniformly valid for all angles, are then used to describe the\nsemiclassical scattering of waves by potentials varying sinusoidally in one\ndirection. In such situations, for instance in the diffraction of atoms by\ngratings made of light, it is common to make the Raman-Nath approximation which\nignores the motion of the atoms inside the grating. When using the\neigenfunctions no such approximation is made so that the dynamical diffraction\nregime (long interaction time) can be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2000 00:59:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2000 10:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-09"}
