The large volume and high\nresolution of these simulations allow an accurate measure of the evolution of\ncosmologically important (but rare) massive clusters at high redshift. The\nsimulated mass function is presented for cluster masses within several radii\ntypically used observationally (R=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 Mpc/h, both comoving and\nphysical) in order to enable direct comparison with current and future\nobservations. The simulated evolution is compared with current observations of\nmassive clusters at redshifts 0.3<z<0.8. The Omega_m=1 tilted SCDM model, which\nexhibits very rapid evolution of the cluster abundance, produces too few\nclusters at z>0.3 and no massive clusters at z>0.5, in stark contradiction with\nobservations. The Omega_m=0.3 models- LCDM, OCDM, and QCDM- all exhibit\nconsiderably weaker evolution and are consistent with current data. Among these\nlow density models, OCDM evolves the least. These trends are enhanced at high\nredshift and can be used to discriminate between flat and open low density\nmodels. The simulated mass functions are compared with the Press-Schechter\napproximation. Standard Press-Schechter predicts too many low mass clusters at\nz=0, and too few clusters at higher redshift. We modify the approximation by a\nsimple parameterization of the density contrast threshold for collapse, which\nhas a redshift dependence. This modified Press-Schechter approximation provides\na good fit to the simulated mass functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2000 22:40:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2001 14:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

For a wide range of temperatures, we have recorded multiple\nfolding events of these three structures from random coils to native\nconformations that differ by less than 1 A dRMS from their crystal structure\ncoordinates. The thermodynamics and kinetic mechanism of the helix-coil\ntransition obtained from our simulation shows excellent agreement with\ncurrently available experimental and molecular dynamics data.

One particular sequence of events constitutes a\n``fast-folding'' pathway where kinetic traps are avoided. At very low\ntemperatures, a kinetic trap arising from the incorrect packing of sidechains\nwas observed.

It is shown\nthat at low enough temperatures the stationary state is non-Gibbsian due to an\nentanglement with the bath. In physical terms, this happens when the cloud of\nbath modes around the particle starts to play a non-trivial role. Indeed,\nequilibrium thermodynamics of the total system, particle plus bath, does not\nimply standard equilibrium thermodynamics for the particle itself at low $T$.\nVarious formulations of the second law are found to be invalid at low $T$.\nFirst, the Clausius inequality can be violated, because heat can be extracted\nfrom the zero point energy of the cloud of bath modes. Second, when the width\nof the confining potential is suddenly changed, there occurs a relaxation to\nequilibrium during which the entropy production is partly negative. Third, for\nnon-adiabatic changes of system parameters the rate of energy dissipation can\nbe negative, and, out of equilibrium, cyclic processes are possible which\nextract work from the bath. Conditions are put forward under which perpetuum\nmobile of the second kind, having one or several work extraction cycles, enter\nthe realm of condensed matter physics. Fourth, it follows that the equivalence\nbetween different formulations of the second law (e.g. those by Clausius and\nThomson) can be violated at low temperatures. These effects are the consequence\nof quantum entanglement in the presence of the slightly off-equilibrium nature\nof the thermal bath, and become important when the characteristic quantum time\nscale $\\hbar/k_BT$ is larger than or comparable to other timescale of the\nsystem.

As a by-product of using the covariant curvature tensor formalism, it is\nimmediately seen that the cosmological scalar, vector and tensor type\nperturbations all have the same Kaluza-Klein spectrum. On the other hand, if\nthere are two branes with positive and negative tensions, the gravity on each\nbrane takes corrections from the radion mode in addition to the Kaluza-Klein\nmodes and the radion is found to have a negative mass-squared proportional to\nthe curvature of the de Sitter brane, in contrast to the flat brane case in\nwhich the radion mass vanishes and degenerates with the 4-dimensional graviton\nmodes.

Passage of a soliton through one\ncell of the link is described by an analytically derived map. Numerical\niterations of the map reveal that, at values of the system's stepsize (cell's\nsize) L comparable to the pulse's dispersion length, SSM supports stable pulses\nwhich almost exactly coincide with fundamental solitons of the averaged NLS\nequation. However, in contrast with the NLS equation, the SSM soliton is a\nstrong attractor, i.e., a perturbed soliton rapidly relaxes to it, emitting\nsome radiation. A pulse whose initial amplitude is too large splits into two\nsolitons; splitting can be suppressed by appropriately chirping the initial\npulse. If the initial amplitude is too small, the pulse turns into a breather,\nand, below a certain threshold, it quickly decays into radiation. If L is\nessentially larger than the soliton's dispersion length, the soliton rapidly\nrearranges itself into another soliton, with nearly the same area but\nessentially smaller energy. At L still larger, the pulse becomes unstable, with\na complex system of stability windows found inside the unstable region. Moving\nsolitons are generated by lending them a frequency shift, which makes it\npossible to consider collisions between solitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2000 19:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The aim is to use wave functions, expressed in terms of\nplus-momentum variables, which are used to analyze high energy experiments such\nas deep inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan production, (e,e') and (p,p')\nreactions. We discuss infinite nuclear matter within the mean field\napproximation; finite nuclei using the mean field approximation;\nnucleon-nucleon scattering, within the one boson exchange approximation; and,\ninfinite nuclear matter including the effects of two-nucleon correlations.\nStandard good results for nuclear saturation properties are obtained, with a\npossible improvement in the lowered value, 180 MeV, of the computed nuclear\ncompressibility. In our approach, manifest rotational invariance emerges at the\nend of the calculation. Thus nuclear physics can be done in a manner in which\nmodern nuclear dynamics can be implemented and symmetries are respected. A\nsalient feature is that $\\omega,\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ mesons are obtained as\nimportant constituents.
