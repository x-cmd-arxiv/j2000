Softening modifies gravity at r=|x-y|\nsmaller than softening length epsilon and the softened forces are increasingly\nbiased for ever larger epsilon. There is, thus, some optimum between reducing\nthe fluctuations and introducing a bias. Here, analytical relations are derived\nfor the amplitudes of the bias and the fluctuations in the limit of small\nepsilon and large N. It is shown that the fluctuations of the force are\ngenerated locally, in contrast to the variations of the potential, which\noriginate from noise in the whole system.

The Plummer softening, where each body is replaced by a Plummer\nsphere of scale radius epsilon, yields significantly larger force errors than\ndo methods in which the bodies are replaced by density kernels of finite\nextent. I also give special kernels, which reduce the errors even further.\nThese kernels largely compensate the errors made with too small inter-particle\nforces at r<epsilon by exceeding Newtonian forces at r epsilon. Additionally,\nthe possibilities of locally adapting epsilon and of using unequal weights for\nthe bodies are investigated. These various techniques allow, without increasing\nN, to reduce the rms force error by a factor 2 compared to Plummer softening\nwith constant epsilon.

Quantum theory predicts that BEC of a\nspatially homogeneous gas with attractive interactions is precluded by a\nconventional phase transition into either a liquid or solid. When confined to a\ntrap, however, such a condensate can form provided that its occupation number\ndoes not exceed a limiting value. The stability limit is determined by a\nbalance between self-attraction and a repulsion arising from position-momentum\nuncertainty under conditions of spatial confinement. Near the stability limit,\nself-attraction can overwhelm the repulsion, causing the condensate to\ncollapse. Growth of the condensate, therefore, is punctuated by intermittent\ncollapses, which are triggered either by macroscopic quantum tunneling or\nthermal fluctuation. Previous observation of growth and collapse has been\nhampered by the stochastic nature of these mechanisms.

We present a systematic study of LF-quantized gauge theory\nfollowing the Dirac method and construct the Dyson-Wick S-matrix expansion\nbased on LF-time-ordered products. The free theory gauge field is shown to\nsatisfy the Lorentz condition as an operator equation as well as the light-cone\ngauge condition. Its propagator is found to be transverse with respect to both\nits four-momentum and the gauge direction. The interaction Hamiltonian of QCD\ncan be expressed in a form resembling that of covariant theory, except for\nadditional instantaneous interactions which can be treated systematically. The\nrenormalization constants in YM theory are shown to satisfy the identity\n$Z_1=Z_3$ at one loop order. The QCD $\\beta$ function computed in the\nnoncovariant light-cone gauge agrees with that known in the conventional\nframework. Some comments on the relationship of our LF framework, with the\ndoubly transverse gauge propagator, to the analytic effective charge and\nrenormalization scheme defined by the pinch technique, the unitarity relations\nand the spectral representation are also made. LF quantization thus provides a\nconsistent formulation of gauge theory, despite the fact that the hyperplanes\n$x^{\\pm}=0$ used to impose boundary conditions constitute characteristic\nsurfaces of a hyperbolic partial differential equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2000 18:13:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2001 21:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-11"}

That is, S(A) > S(A,B), where S(.) is the von Neumann entropy. It is\nknown that satisfaction of this inequality implies that a state is\nnon-separable. In this paper we prove the stronger result that for separable\nstates the vector of eigenvalues of the density matrix of system AB is\nmajorized by the vector of eigenvalues of the density matrix of system A alone.\nThis gives a strong sense in which a separable state is more disordered\nglobally than locally and a new necessary condition for separability of\nbipartite states in arbitrary dimensions. We also investigate the extent to\nwhich these conditions are sufficient to characterize separability, exhibiting\nexamples that show separability cannot be characterized solely in terms of the\nlocal and global spectra of a state. We apply our conditions to give a simple\nproof that non-separable states exist sufficiently close to the completely\nmixed state of $n$ qudits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2000 00:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
