This effect\ncan be easily explained as an aperture bias, whereby galaxies with globally\nlate-type spectra are assigned earlier spectral types which depend on the\nredshift and luminosity of the galaxy. The effect is demonstrated by extracting\nsuccessively larger aperture spectra from long-slit spectroscopy of nearby\ngalaxies.

Super--sonic turbulence fragments\nMCs into dense sheets, filaments and cores and large low density ``voids'', via\nthe action of highly radiative shocks. We refer to this process as \"turbulent\nfragmentation\". In this work we derive the mass distribution of gravitationally\nunstable cores generated by the process of turbulent fragmentation. The mass\ndistribution above one solar mass depends primarily on the power spectrum of\nthe turbulent flow and on the jump conditions for isothermal shocks in a\nmagnetized gas. For a power spectrum index \\beta=-1.74, consistent with\nLarson's velocity dispersion--size relation as well as with new numerical and\nanalytic results on super--sonic turbulence, we obtain a power law mass\ndistribution of dense cores with a slope equal to 3/(4-\\beta) = 1.33,\nconsistent with the slope of the stellar IMF. Below one solar mass, the mass\ndistribution flattens and turns around at a fraction of a solar mass, as\nobserved for the stellar IMF in a number of stellar clusters, because only the\ndensest cores are gravitationally unstable. The mass distribution at low masses\nis determined by the probability distribution of the gas density, which is\nknown to be approximately Log--Normal for an isothermal turbulent gas. The\nintermittent nature of the turbulent density distribution is thus responsible\nfor the existence of a significant number of small collapsing cores, even of\nsub--stellar mass. Since turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable in\nsuper--sonically turbulent molecular clouds, and given the success of the\npresent model in predicting the observed shape of the stellar IMF, we conclude\nthat turbulent fragmentation is essential to the origin of the stellar IMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2000 00:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 May 2002 09:31:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2002 23:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This constraint allows us\nto make a simple consistency check of several models. We show that the\ntwo-brane Randall-Sundrum model satisfies this constraint, but it does not\nallow a generalization with smooth branes (domain walls), independently of the\nissue of supersymmetry. The Goldberger-Wise model of brane stabilization has to\ninclude the backreaction on the metric and the fine tuning of the cosmological\nconstant to satisfy the constraints.

A lack of a continuum\nspectrum is taken as evidence that the stable tachyon vacuum does not support\nconventional gauge excitations. For the bosonic string model we find two\npossible solvable couplings, one closely related to Born-Infeld forms and the\nother allowing a detailed comparison to the open string modes on bosonic\nD-branes.
