This control can yield\neither the inhibition (Zeno effect) or the acceleration (anti-Zeno effect) of\nthe quasi-exponential decay of the observed state by means of frequent\nmeasurements. In the discussed scheme, a photon is bouncing back and forth\nbetween two perfect mirrors, each time passing a polarization rotator. The\nhorizontal and vertical polarizations can be viewed as analogs of an excited\nand a ground state of a two level system (TLS). A polarization beam splitter\nand an absorber for the vertically polarized photon are inserted between the\nmirrors, and effect measurements of the polarization. The polarization angle\nacquired in the electrooptic polarization rotator can fluctuate randomly, e.g.,\nvia noisy modulation. In the absence of an absorber the polarization\nrandomization corresponds to TLS decay into an infinite-temperature reservoir.\nThe non-Markovian nature of the decay stems from the many round-trips required\nfor the randomization. We consider the influence of the polarization\nmeasurements by the absorber on this non-Markovian decay, and develop a theory\nof the Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Nov 2000 09:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
