We argue that, on theoretical grounds, it is likely that the\ncore neutron superfluid does not participate in the free precession of the\ncrust. We apply our model to the handful of proposed observations of free\nprecession that have appeared in the literature. Assuming crust-only\nprecession, we find that all but one of the observations are consistent with\nthere not being any pinned crustal superfluid at all; the maximum amount of\npinned superfluid consistent with the observations is about 10^-10 of the total\nstellar moment of inertia. However, the observations do not rule out the\npossibility that the crust and neutron superfluid core precess as a single\nunit. In this case the maximum amount of pinned superfluid consistent with the\nobservations is about 10^-8 of the total stellar moment of inertia. Both of\nthese values are many orders of magnitude less than the 10^-2 value predicted\nby many theories of pulsar glitches.

The\nMIST fits account for the measurement errors on the variables and their\ncorrelations as well as for the intrinsic scatter. We show that the lack of a\nmodel of the intrinsic scatter of the FP is the origin of the systematic\ndifferences between the various fitting methods.\n  We also address the problem of estimating the uncertainties of the FP\ncoefficients and determine a simple relation between the sample size and the\nexpected accuracy of the coefficients.\n  The present study leads to define a `minimum sample size' for a correct\nestimate of the uncertainties. For N < 30, both theoretical formulae and\nre-sampling techniques, like the bootstrap, do not give reliable estimates.\n  The question of the 'universality' of the FP is addressed by applying the\nMIST fits to ten samples of cluster galaxies. The FP slopes are actually\nconsistent between the different samples, but, due to the large uncertainties,\nthey could also hide significant systematic differences.\n  The feasibility of the measurement of the possible variations of the FP\nslopes as a function of redshift is also proved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2000 08:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

M\\\"ulliken population analyses and orbital-resolved\ndensities of states show that the configuration of Mn in GaAs is compatible\nwith either 3d$^5$ or 3d$^6$, however the occupation is not integer due to the\nlarge $p$-$d$ hybridization between the Mn $d$ states and the valence band of\nGaAs. The spin splitting of the conduction band of GaAs has a mean field-like\nlinear variation with the Mn concentration and indicates ferromagnetic coupling\nwith the Mn ions.

Gaussian sum-rule analysis techniques are\napplied to the problematic scalar glueball channel to determine masses, widths\nand relative resonance strengths of low-lying scalar glueball states\ncontributing to the hadronic spectral function. A feature of our analysis is\nthe inclusion of instanton contributions to the scalar gluonic correlation\nfunction. Compared with the next-to-leading Gaussian sum-rule, the analysis of\nthe lowest-weighted sum-rule (which contains a large scale-independent\ncontribution from the low energy theorem) is shown to be unreliable because of\ninstability under QCD uncertainties. However, the presence of instanton effects\nleads to approximately consistent mass scales in the lowest weighted and\nnext-lowest weighted sum-rules. The analysis of the next-to-leading sum-rule\ndemonstrates that a single narrow resonance model does not provide an adequate\ndescription of the hadronic spectral function. Consequently, we consider a wide\nvariety of phenomenological models which distribute resonance strength over a\nbroad region---some of which lead to excellent agreement between the\ntheoretical prediction and phenomenological models. Including QCD\nuncertainties, our results indicate that the hadronic contributions to the\nspectral function stem from a pair of resonances with masses in the range\n0.8--1.6 GeV, with the lighter of the two potentially having a large width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2000 20:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2000 15:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2001 22:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A new knock-out mode is described\nwhich might occur during heavy ion collisions. The outer shell-nucleons are\nionised due to the increase of level energy when two nuclei are approaching\nfast enough. This is analogous to the Mott effect but in contrast occurs only\nif the reaction time is short enough that no common ionisation threshold in the\ncompound system is established. To demonstrate this pure nonequilibrium effect\na simulation of realistic heavy ion collision by a nonlocal Boltzmann equation\nis performed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2000 08:01:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2001 17:02:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2001 09:34:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2001 13:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
