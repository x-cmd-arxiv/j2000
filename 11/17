In\nthe first week the spectra are characterised by prominent broad emission lines\nwith narrow peaks superimposed on a very blue continuum(T~24000K). In the\nfollowing two weeks broad, blueshifted absorption components appeared in the\nspectra and the temperature dropped. By day 44, broad emission components in H\nand He reappeared in the spectra. These persisted to 100-130d, becoming\nincreasingly asymmetric. We agree with Leonard et al. (2000) that the broad\nemission lines indicate interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM) and deduce that progenitor of SN 1998S appears to have gone\nthrough at least two phases of mass loss, giving rise to two CSM zones.\nExamination of the spectra indicates that the inner zone extended to <90AU,\nwhile the outer CSM extended from 185AU to over 1800AU. Analysis of high\nresolution spectra shows that the outer CSM had a velocity of 40-50 km/s.\nAssuming a constant velocity, we can infer that the outer CSM wind commenced\nmore than 170 years ago, and ceased about 20 years ago, while the inner CSM\nwind may have commenced less than 9 years ago. During the era of the outer CSM\nwind the outflow was high, >2x10^{-5}M_{\\odot}/yr corresponding to a mass loss\nof at least 0.003M_{\\odot} and suggesting a massive progenitor. We also model\nthe CO emission observed in SN 1998S. We deduce a CO mass of ~10^{-3} M_{\\odot}\nmoving at ~2200km/s, and infer a mixed metal/He core of ~4M_{\\odot}, again\nindicating a massive progenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2000 15:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
