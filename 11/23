Line emission should be an indicator of star formation\nactivity, but searches based on Lyman-alpha are unreliable because of the\nselective extinction of this resonant UV line. Using more robust lines such as\nH-alpha forces a move to the near-infrared at z>1.

A new method,\neasily incorporated in the TermiLog system for automatic termination analysis,\nis presented for showing termination in this case.\n  The method consists of the following steps: First, a finite abstract domain\nfor representing the range of integers is deduced automatically. Based on this\nabstraction, abstract interpretation is applied to the program. The result is a\nfinite number of atoms abstracting answers to queries which are used to extend\nthe technique of query-mapping pairs. For each query-mapping pair that is\npotentially non-terminating, a bounded (integer-valued) termination function is\nguessed. If traversing the pair decreases the value of the termination\nfunction, then termination is established. Simple functions often suffice for\neach query-mapping pair, and that gives our approach an edge over the classical\napproach of using a single termination function for all loops, which must\ninevitably be more complicated and harder to guess automatically. It is worth\nnoting that the termination of McCarthy's 91 function can be shown\nautomatically using our method.\n  In summary, the proposed approach is based on combining a finite abstraction\nof the integers with the technique of the query-mapping pairs, and is\nessentially capable of dividing a termination proof into several cases, such\nthat a simple termination function suffices for each case. Consequently, the\nwhole process of proving termination can be done automatically in the framework\nof TermiLog and similar systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2000 09:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
