Their gas\nextinction is found to be large (Av ~ 1.5 mag) leading to an upward revision of\ntheir star formation rate (SFR) to an average value of ~ 40 Mo/yr. Large\nextinction values are also supported by the large rate of detection in one\nfield observed by ISO. Gas metal abundances in LCGs have about half the solar\nvalue. We argue that LCGs are the progenitors of present-day spiral bulges.\nLCGs have masses and light concentrations similar to those of present-day\nbulges. As in present-day galactic bulges, LCG stars show a wide range of\nabundances. Thus, observing LCGs allows us to directly witness an important\nstage in the formation of a massive galaxy, the building of the bulge prior to\nthat of the disk. The gas needed to feed the observed star formation is likely\nto be falling in from the outskirts of the galaxy, being tidally pulled out\nfrom interacting companion galaxies. Some LCGs also show evidence for the\nbeginning of a disk formation. If the above scenario holds for most LCGs, we\nestimate that at least 20% of present-day spiral galaxies have formed the bulk\nof their stars at relatively recent epochs, during the last 8-9 Gyr, at\nredshifts less than ~ 1. Since they are heavily extincted, we predict their IR\nluminosities to be relatively large, around Lir = 10^11 Lsun, i.e. near or\nslightly below the luminosities of the galaxies detected by ISO in the same\nredshift range. Taking into account the integrated IR luminosity of the LCG\ngalaxy population can lead to a significant upward revision of the cosmic SFR\ndensity in the redshift range from 0.5 to 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2000 14:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Quarks\nand leptons live at brane intersections, and are thus located at different\npositions in the extra dimensions. Replication of families follows naturally\nfrom the fact that the branes generically intersect at several points. Gauge\nand Yukawa couplings can be computed in terms of the compactification radii.\nHierarchical Yukawa couplings appear naturally, since amplitudes involving\nthree different intersections are proportional to exp{-A_{ijk}}, where A_{ijk}\nis the area of a string world-sheet extending among the intersections. The\nmodels are non-supersymmetric but the string scale may be lowered down to 1-10\nTeV.
