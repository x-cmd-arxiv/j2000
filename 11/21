In the following, I shall explain what\nrelation exists between Feynman graphs and the teleparallel theory of Einstein\nand Cartan in the late 1920s, and the relation of both to the theories of the\nincompressible aether around 1840. Reviewing these developments, we will have a\nlook at the continuum theory of dislocations developed by Kroener in the 1950s\nand some techniques of differential geometry and topology relevant for a modern\ndescription of defects in continous media. I will then illustrate some basic\nconcepts of nonlinear continuum mechanics and discuss applications to the above\ntheories. By doing so, I hope to attract attention to the possible relevance of\nthese facts for `fundamental' physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2000 21:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
