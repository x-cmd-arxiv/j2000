A direct comparison between these simulations suggests that there are\ntwo major mechanisms by which outflows affect dwarf formation. Firstly, the\nformation of an outflow slows down the further accretion of gas onto a galaxy,\ncausing an overall decrease of approximately 50% in the total gas mass accreted\nby the objects in our simulations. Additionally, our simulations uncover a\nsignificant population of approximately 10^9 solar mass objects whose formation\nis suppressed by the mechanism of ``baryonic stripping,'' in which outflows\nfrom early galaxies strip the gas out of nearby overdense regions that would\nhave otherwise later formed into dwarf galaxies.
