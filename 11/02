The history of star formation and the amount\nof total gas (per unit mass) of galaxies are found to depend primarily on their\ntotal masses (as traced by the H band luminosities) and only secondarily on\nmorphological type. The present star formation activity of massive spirals is\nup to 100 times smaller than that average over their lifetime, while in low\nmass galaxies it is comparable to or higher than that at earlier epochs.

Here we discuss high-resolution (6.7 km/s) spectra\nof the AALs in the radio-loud quasar 3C 191 (redshift z=1.956). The measured\nAALs have ionizations ranging from Mg I to N V, and multi-component profiles\nthat are blueshifted by ~400 to ~1400 km/s relative to the quasar's broad\nemission lines. These data yield the following new results. 1) The density\nbased on Si II*/Si II lines is ~300 cm-3, implying a distance of ~28 kpc from\nthe quasar if the gas is photoionized. 2) The characteristic flow time is thus\n\\~3 x 10^7 yr. 3) Strong Mg I AALs identify neutral gas with very low\nionization parameter and high density. We estimate n_H > 5 x 10^4 cm-3 in this\nregion, compared to ~15 cm-3 where the N V lines form. 4) The total column\ndensity is N_H < 4 x 10^18 cm-2 in the neutral gas and N_H ~ 2 x 10^20 cm-2 in\nthe moderately ionized regions. 5) The total mass in the AAL outflow is M ~ 2 x\n10^9 Mo, assuming a global covering factor (as viewed from the quasar) of ~10%\n>. 6) The absorbing gas only partially covers the background light source(s)\nalong our line(s) of sight, requiring absorption in small clouds or filaments\n<0.01 pc across.

We\npropose a model for the absorber in which pockets of dense neutral gas are\nsurrounded by larger clouds of generally lower density and higher ionization.\nThis outflowing material might be leftover from a blowout associated with a\nnuclear starburst, the onset of quasar activity or a past broad absorption line\n(BAL) wind phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2000 20:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

Twelve ultraviolet spectra of OO Aql were obtained in\n1988 with the IUE satellite, including a series of consecutive observations\nthat cover nearly a complete orbital cycle. Chromospheric activity is studied\nby means of the Mg II h+k emission at 2800 A. The Mg II emission is found to\nvary, even when the emission is normalized to the adjacent continuum flux. This\nvariation may be correlated with orbital phase in the 1988 observations. It\nalso appears that the normalized Mg II emission varies with time, as seen in\nspectra obtained at two different epochs in 1988 and when compared with two\nspectra obtained several years earlier. The level of chromospheric activity in\nOO Aql is less than that of other W UMa-type binaries of similar colors, but\nthis is attributed to its early stage of contact binary evolution. Ultraviolet\nlight curves were composed from measurements of the ultraviolet continuum in\nthe spectra.

For a single particle, the system is a combination of\nthe Schroedinger and Poisson equations modified so that the probability density\nof the wavefunction is the source of the potential in the Schroedinger\nequation. For spherically symmetric wavefunctions, a discrete set of energy\neigenvalue solutions emerges for dimensions $D<6$, accumulating at D=6.\nInvoking Heisenberg's uncertainty principle to assign timescales of collapse\ncorrespoding to each energy eigenvalue, we find that these timescales may vary\nby many orders of magnitude depending on dimension. For example, the time taken\nfor the wavefunction of a free neutron in a spherically symmetric state to\ncollapse is many orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe,\nwhereas for one confined to a box of picometer-sized cross-sectional dimensions\nthe collapse time is about two weeks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2000 20:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Starting from the Scully-Lamb master equation, we present a\nfully analytical treatment to determine the correlation function and the\nspectrum of the cavity field at steady state. For this purpose, we develop an\nanalytical approximation method that implicitly incorporates the microscopic\nfluctuations of both the phase and intensity of the field, and, in addition,\ntakes full account of the saturation of the nonlinear gain. Our main result is\na simple formula for the quantum-limited linewidth that is valid from near to\nfar above threshold and also includes the presence of thermal photons. Close to\nthe threshold, the linewidth is twice as large as predicted by the standard\nphase-diffusion treatment neglecting intensity fluctuations, and even 50% above\nthreshold the increase is still considerable. In general, quantum fluctuations\nof the intensity are present and continue to influence the linewidth as long as\nthe photon-number distribution is not strictly Poissonian. This inherent\nrelationship is displayed by a formula relating the linewidth and the Mandel\nQ-parameter. More than 100% above treshold the linewidth is found to be smaller\nthan predicted by the standard treatment, since the simple phase-diffusion\nmodel increasingly overestimates the rate of phase fluctuations by neglecting\ngain saturation. In the limit of a very large mean photon number the expected\nperfectly coherent classical field is obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2000 16:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
