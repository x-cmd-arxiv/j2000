By way of contrast, there are many more atomistic computations for bcc\nmetals, as well as mixed discrete-continuum computations of the Peierls-Nabarro\ntype for fcc metals. One of the reasons for this is the low Peierls stresses in\nfcc metals. Because atomistic computations of the Peierls stress take place in\nfinite simulation cells, image forces caused by boundaries must either be\nrelaxed or corrected for if system size independent results are to be obtained.\nOne of the approaches that has been developed for treating such boundary forces\nis by computing them directly and subsequently subtracting their effects, as\ndeveloped by V.

Based on a simple detector simulation, we have determined\nthe integrated luminosity necessary to discover the SM Higgs in the mass range\n100-190 GeV. The first phase of the Run 2 Higgs search, with a total integrated\nluminosity of 2 fb-1 per detector, will provide a 95% CL exclusion sensitivity\ncomparable to that expected at the end of the LEP2 run. With 10 fb-1 per\ndetector, this exclusion will extend up to Higgs masses of 180 GeV, and a\ntantalizing 3 sigma effect will be visible if the Higgs mass lies below 125\nGeV. With 25 fb-1 of integrated luminosity per detector, evidence for SM Higgs\nproduction at the 3 sigma level is possible for Higgs masses up to 180 GeV.\nHowever, the discovery reach is much less impressive for achieving a 5 sigma\nHiggs boson signal. Even with 30 fb-1 per detector, only Higgs bosons with\nmasses up to about 130 GeV can be detected with 5 sigma significance. These\nresults can also be re-interpreted in the MSSM framework and yield the required\nluminosities to discover at least one Higgs boson of the MSSM Higgs sector.\nWith 5-10 fb-1 of data per detector, it will be possible to exclude at 95% CL\nnearly the entire MSSM Higgs parameter space, whereas 20-30 fb-1 is required to\nobtain a 5 sigma Higgs discovery over a significant portion of the parameter\nspace.

It has been\nshown long time ago that, at the quantum mechanical level, a composite dyon\nmade out of a magnetic pole of charge g and a particle of electric charge e\npossesses half-integral spin and fermionic statistics, if the constituents are\nbosons and the Dirac quantization condition $eg=2\\pi n$ holds, with n odd. This\nphenomenon is called spin-statistics transmutation. We show that the same\nphenomenon occurs at the quantum field theory level for an elementary dyon.\nThis analysis requires the construction of gauge invariant charged dyon fields.\nDirac's proposal for such fields, relying on a Coulomb-like photon cloud, leads\nto quantum correlators exhibiting an unphysical dependence on the Dirac-string.\nRecently Froehlich and Marchetti proposed a recipe for charged dyon fields,\nbased on a sum over Mandelstam-strings, which overcomes this problem. Using\nthis recipe we derive explicit expressions for the quantum field theory\ncorrelators and we provide a proof of the occurrence of spin-statistics\ntransmutation. The proof reduces to a computation of the self-linking numbers\nof dyon worldlines and Mandelstam strings, projected on a fixed time\nthree-space. Dyon composites are also analysed. The transmutation discussed in\nthis paper bares some analogy with the appearance of anomalous spin and\nstatistics for particles or vortices in Chern-Simons theories in 2+1\ndimensions.
