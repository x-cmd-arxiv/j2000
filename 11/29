The particle increases have\nbeen explained variously as due to diffusion from a field line connection with\na CIR at a greater distance, perpendicular diffusion in latitude, propagation\nfrom the inner Corona or an acceleration process on a connecting field line.\nNumerical solutions to the 1-D propagation equation upstream of a CIR shock for\nreasonable diffusion mean free paths are shown here to limit the source of the\nincreases to within about 2 AU of the CIR's, asssuming the CIR's either trap or\naccelerate energetic particles and they diffuse from the nearby CIR interface.\nThe problem of allowing propagation from the CIR's is eased if the CIRs are\nlocated according to the predictions for the current sheet with a solar source\nsurface at $2.5 R_{s}$, rather than at $3.25 R_{s}$. Energetic electron\nobservations showing delays with respect to the CIR-associated ions suggest\npossibly an acceleration in the inner corona, rather than in the CIR-associated\nshock. A more likely explanation, however, is the ability of electrons to take\na longer a longer route, from beyond the point of observation, than for that of\nthe ions and yet arrive within a few days of CIR closest approach time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2000 16:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Mass tells\nspace how to curve and space tells mass how to move. Newtonian gravity equation\nmakes a distinction between them by having its numerator as mass effect and its\ndenominator as inverse square law space effect at macroscopic approximation. At\nmicroscopic distances it makes sense to substitute surface-to-surface distance\nbetween two nucleons for center-to-center distance between them to account for\nthe mass space distinction, keeping in mind the smallest distance between\ncoupled nucleons is Planck length. Any distance less than Planck makes no sense\nin the classical world. When we calculate the force between two nucleons of one\nfemtometer diameter each, separated by a surface-to-surface distance of Planck\nlength, we get the force that matches well known nuclear force i.e. 10E40 times\nthe value of the force of gravitation ``g'' calculated by assuming the\nNewtonian center-to-center distance of 1 femtometer. What we get is what is\ndescribed as the nuclear force in scientific literature. This leads to the\nquestion: Is the nuclear force (well recognized secondary effect of color\nforce) high intensity gravitation?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2000 20:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
