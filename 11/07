The\nattained limiting sensitivity is of ~ 2.4 10^-15 erg sec^-1} cm^-2 in the\n0.1--4.0 keV bandpass. This has been achieved by summing the data of the MOS\nand PN cameras of two distinct observations for a total exposure time of ~ 33\nks and by analyzing the summed data set with the wavelet detection algorithm\ndeveloped at Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo (OAPA) that has yielded over\n200 X-ray detections. Using data just from a single exposure or from a single\ncamera would have reduced by a factor 2--4 our limiting sensitivity and would\nhave resulted in 25--40% less X-ray detections. To date, 129 detections have as\ncounterparts one or more of the 540 photometrically selected cluster members in\nthe surveyed region, for a total of 147 likely detected members, with unique\nidentification in 112 cases. We derive the X-ray luminosity functions (XLF) of\nNGC 2516 members of different spectral types and compare them with those of the\nmore metal rich, approximately coeval Pleiades cluster, finding the NGC 2516\nphotometrically selected dG and dK stars less luminous than the Pleiades. The\nXLFs of the NGC 2516 and of the Pleiades dM stars are indistinguishable. We\ncompare the XMM-Newton results with those recently obtained with Chandra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2000 12:30:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The X-ray outburst was unusual in that the source remained in the\nlow/hard X-ray state throughout; the X-ray peak was also preceded by at least\none optical outburst, suggesting that it was an `outside-in' outburst - similar\nto those observed in dwarf novae systems, although possibly taking place on a\nviscous timescale in this case.

While the radio source was too faint to detect\nany extended structure, spectral analysis of the radio data and a comparison\nwith other similar systems suggests that mass ejections, probably in the form\nof a jet, took place and that the emitted synchrotron spectrum may have\nextended as far as infrared wavelengths.

Early we\nreported the Gaussian model of the vortex tangle in superfluid turbulent HeII.\nThat model is just trial distribution functional in space of vortex loop\nconfigurations constructed on the basis of well established properties of\nvortex tangle. It is designed to calculate various averages taken over\nstochastic vortex loop configurations. In this paper we use this model to\ncalculate some important characteristics of the vortex tangle. In particular we\nevaluate the average superfluid mass current J induced by vortices and the\naverage energy E associated with the chaotic vortex filament.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2000 05:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In particular, we discuss a\nclass of models where soft supersymmetry breaking terms are determined by quasi\nmodel independent anomaly mediated contributions, with possibly non-vanishing\nscalar masses at the one loop level. We show that the latter contribution\ndepends on the detailed prescription of the regularization process which is\nassumed to represent the Planck scale physics of the underlying fundamental\ntheory. The usual anomaly mediation case with vanishing scalar masses at one\nloop is not found to be generic. However gaugino masses and A-terms always\nvanish at tree level if supersymmetry breaking is moduli dominated with the\nmoduli stabilized at self-dual points, whereas the vanishing of the B-term\ndepends on the origin of the mu-term in the underlying theory.
