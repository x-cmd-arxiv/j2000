The data show that roughly half of the total luminosity\nof the BCD originates from a bright and compact starburst region located at the\nnortheastern tip of a faint dwarf galaxy with cometary appearance. The\nstarburst has ignited less than 4 Myr ago and its emission is powered by\nseveral thousands O7V stars and ~ 170 late-type nitrogen Wolf-Rayet stars\nlocated within a compact region with < 500 pc in diameter. For the first time\nin a BCD, a relatively strong [Fe V] 4227 emission line is seen which together\nwith intense He II 4686 emission indicates the presence of a very hard\nradiation field in Tol 1214-277. We argue that this extraordinarily hard\nradiation originates from both Wolf--Rayet stars and radiative shocks in the\nstarburst region.

On the other hand, sinusoidal or\nsquare-wave modulation (either periodic or stochastic) may lead to a bimodal\nhistogram. We here present evidence that the neutrino flux histogram is in fact\nbimodal. We analyze all available data from gallium experiments, coordinating\nresults from the GALLEX and GNO experiments into one data set, and adopting\nresults from the SAGE experiment as another data set. The two histograms, from\nthe two data sets, are consistent in showing peaks in the range 45-75 SNU and\n90-120 SNU, with a valley in between. By combining the data into one data set,\nwe may form more detailed histograms; these strengthen the case that the flux\nis bimodal. A preliminary statistical analysis indicates that the bimodal\ncharacter of the solar neutrino flux is highly significant. Since the upper\npeak is close to the expected flux (120-140 SNU), we may infer that the\nneutrino deficit is due to time-varying attenuation of the flux produced in the\ncore. We estimate the time scale of this variation to be in the range 10-60\ndays. Attenuation that varies on such a time scale is suggestive of the\ninfluence of solar rotation, and points towards a process involving the solar\nmagnetic field in conjunction with a nonzero neutrino magnetic moment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2000 19:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The proof uses the new $L^p$-bound on the spectral shift function\nrecently obtained by Combes, Hislop, and Nakamura.

Such a conception reminds the Ptolemaic doctrine of celestial\nmechanics. Alternative research program, which uses a more correct space-time\nmodel and does not need additional hypotheses (quantum principles) for free\nexplanations of quantum effects, is suggested. If the more correct space-time\nmodel were known in the beginning of XXth century, when research of microcosm\nstarted, quantum mechanics could develop in other way. The alternative research\nprogram appeared with a secular delay, because all this time the necessary\nmathematical technique was not available for researchers. Absence of necessary\nmathematical technique is connected with some prejudices which have been\novercame at the construction of new conception of geometry and that of\nstatistical description. Basic statements of the new mathematical technique and\nprinciples of its application in alternative research program are presented in\nthe paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Nov 2000 11:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2000 08:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2001 09:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
