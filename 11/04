We presume the\naccretion disks to be geometrically thin and supported vertically by radiation\npressure. We fully incorporate the effects of a nonzero radiative diffusion\nlength on the linear modes. In an equilibrium with purely vertical magnetic\nfield, the vertical magnetorotational modes are completely unaffected by\ncompressibility, stratification, and radiative diffusion. However, in the\npresence of azimuthal fields, which are expected in differentially rotating\nflows, the growth rate of all magnetorotational modes can be reduced\nsubstantially below the orbital frequency. This occurs if diffusion destroys\nradiation sound waves on the length scale of the instability, and the magnetic\nenergy density of the azimuthal component exceeds the non-radiative thermal\nenergy density. While sluggish in this case, the magnetorotational instability\nstill persists and will still tap the free energy of the differential rotation.\nPhoton bubble instabilities are generically present in radiation pressure\ndominated flows where diffusion is present. We show that their growth rates are\nlimited to a maximum value which is reached at short wavelengths where the\nmodes may be viewed as unstable slow magnetosonic waves. We also find that\nvertical radiation pressure destabilizes upward propagating fast waves, and\nthat Alfv\\'en waves can be unstable.
