However,\nwe have found the observed luminosity is an order of magnitude smaller than the\ntheoretical estimate, which indicates the white dwarf is permanently blocked by\nthe accretion disk, and we are observing a scattering emission by a fully\nionized accretion disk corona (ADC) whose column density is ~ 1.5 x 10^{23}\ncm^{-2}. Through simulation, we have shown that the orbital eclipse can be\nexplained by the ADC model, such that a part of the extended X-ray emission\nfrom the ADC is blocked by the companion star filling its Roche lobe. We have\nfound that very high surface gravity and temperature, ~ 10^{10} cm s^{-2} and ~\n100 eV respectively, as well as a strong absorption edge at ~ 1.02 keV, are\nrequired to explain the X-ray energy spectrum of RXJ0925.7-4758.

We elucidate the phase diagram near the critical temperature in\nthe space of the parameters characterizing the thermodynamic potential terms of\nfourth order in the pairing gap. Within the color and flavor antisymmetric\nchannel with zero total angular momentum, the phase diagram contains an\nisoscalar (IS) color-antitriplet phase and a color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase,\nreached by a second order transition from the normal state, as well as states\nreached by a first order transition. We complement the general Ginzburg-Landau\napproach by deriving the high-density asymptotic form of the Ginzburg-Landau\nfree energy from the weak-coupling gap equation. The dynamically-screened,\nlong-range color magnetic interactions are taken into account in solving the\ngap equation. We find that in the limit of weak coupling, the IS phase is less\nfavorable near the transition temperature than the CFL phase. In view of the\nfact that deconfined quark matter must be color charge neutral, we incorporate\nthe constraint of overall color neutrality into the Ginzburg-Landau theory and\nthe gap equation. This constraint yields a disparity in the chemical potential\nbetween colors and reduces the size of the gap, in the presence of the\nanisotropy of the order parameters in color space. In comparison with the case\nin which there are no chemical potential differences between colors and hence\nthe superfluid generally has nonzero net color charge, we find that while the\nconstraint of color neutrality has only negligible effects on the gap in the\nweak coupling regime, it appreciably destabilizes the IS phase in the strong\ncoupling regime without affecting the CFL phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2000 05:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
