Furthermore, these lines are\nsingle-peaked which implies that they may be formed in a disk wind similar to\nthose we have proposed as producing the broad emission lines seen in the UV\nspectra of active galactic nuclei. We compute line profiles as a function of\neclipse phase and compare them to the observed line profiles. Various effects\nmay modify the appearance of the lines including resonant scattering in the\nwind itself, self-shadowing of the warped disk from the central continuum, and\nself-obscuration of parts of the disk along the observer's line-of-sight. These\nlatter two effects can cause orbital and precessional phase dependent\nvariations in the emission lines. Hence, examination of the line profiles as a\nfunction of these phases can, in principle, provide additional information on\nthe characteristics of the disk warp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Nov 2000 18:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The method\nrelies on the adiabatic invariance of the action integrals of motion for the\nhalo population during the slow accumulation of a disk component, subsequent to\nearlier halo formation. The method is then applied to a sample of local stars\nwith [Fe/H]<=-1.5, likely to be dominated by the halo component, taken from\nBeers et al.'s recently revised and supplemented catalog of metal-poor stars\nselected without kinematic bias. We find that even if the Galactic potential is\nmade spherical by removing the disk component in an adiabatic manner, the halo\ndensity distribution in the inner halo region (R <= 15 kpc) remains moderately\nflattened, with axial ratio of about 0.8 for stars in the abundance range\n[Fe/H]<=-1.8 and about 0.7 for the more metal-rich interval -1.8<[Fe/H]<=-1.5.\nThe outer halo remains spherical for both abundance intervals. We also find\nthat this initial flattening of the inner halo is caused by the anisotropic\nvelocity dispersions of the halo stars. These results suggest that the\ntwo-component nature of the present-day stellar halo, characterized by a highly\nflattened inner halo and nearly spherical outer halo, is a consequence of both\nan initially two-component density distribution of the halo (perhaps a\nsignature of dissipative halo formation) and of the adiabatic flattening of the\ninner part by later disk formation. Further implications of our results for the\nformation of the Galaxy are also discussed, in particular in the context of the\nhierarchical clustering scenario of galaxy formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2000 01:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Because of the turbulent\nnature of super-sonic motions in MCs, it has been suggested that dense\nstructures such as filaments and clumps are formed by shocks in a turbulent\nflow. In this work we present strong evidence in favor of the turbulent origin\nof the fragmentation of MCs. The most generic result of turbulent fragmentation\nis that dense post shock gas traces a gas component with a smaller velocity\ndispersion than lower density gas, since shocks correspond to regions of\nconverging flows, where the kinetic energy of the turbulent motion is\ndissipated. Using synthetic maps of spectra of molecular transitions, computed\nfrom the results of numerical simulations of super--sonic turbulence, we show\nthat the dependence of velocity dispersion on gas density generates an\nobservable relation between the rms velocity centroid and the integrated\nintensity (column density), Sigma(V_0)-I, which is indeed found in the\nobservational data. The comparison between the theoretical model (maps of\nsynthetic 13CO spectra), with 13CO maps from the Perseus, Rosette and Taurus MC\ncomplexes, shows excellent agreement in the Sigma(V_0)-I relation. The\nSigma(V_0)-I relation of different observational maps with the same total rms\nvelocity are remarkably similar, which is a strong indication of their origin\nfrom a very general property of the fluid equations, such as the turbulent\nfragmentation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2000 15:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Differences between quantum expectation\nvalues and classical Liouville averages are examined for both regular and\nchaotic dynamics well beyond the short-time regime of narrow states. We find\nthat quantum-classical differences initially grow exponentially with a\ncharacteristic exponent consistently larger than the largest Lyapunov exponent.\nWe provide numerical evidence that the time of the break between the quantum\nand classical predictions scales as log(${\\cal J}/ \\hbar$), where ${\\cal J}$ is\na characteristic system action. However, this log break-time rule applies only\nwhile the quantum-classical deviations are smaller than order hbar. We find\nthat the quantum observables remain well approximated by classical Liouville\naverages over long times even for the chaotic motions of a few\ndegree-of-freedom system. To obtain this correspondence it is not necessary to\nintroduce the decoherence effects of a many degree-of-freedom environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2000 10:38:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2001 22:12:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
