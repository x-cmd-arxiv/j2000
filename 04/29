An extensive body of rotation curve observations of\ndwarf and low surface brightness galaxies shows the dark haloes of those\nsystems to be characterized by soft constant density central cores. Several\nphysical processes have been proposed to produce soft cores in dark haloes,\neach one with different scaling properties. With the aim of discriminating\namong them we have examined the rotation curves of dark matter dominated dwarf\nand low surface brightness galaxies and the inner mass profiles of two clusters\nof galaxies lacking a central cD galaxy and with evidence of soft cores in the\ncentre. The core radii and central densities of these haloes scale in a well\ndefined manner with the depth of their potential wells, as measured through the\nmaximum circular velocity. As a result of our analysis we identify\nself-interacting CDM as a viable solution to the core problem, where a\nnon-singular isothermal core is formed in the halo center surrounded by a\nNavarro, Frenk, & White profile in the outer parts. We show that this\nparticular physical situation predicts core radii in agreement with\nobservations. Furthermore, using the observed scalings, we derive an expression\nfor the minimum cross section (\\sigma) which has an explicit dependence with\nthe halo dispersion velocity (v).
