In this connection we have taken the\nopposite direction of the GRWP argument, that the cosmic background radiation\n(CBR) has originated from a fundamental stochastic hitting process. We assume\nthe CBR as a clue of the Big Bang, playing a main role in the decoupling of the\nstate vector dynamics of the CM and internal motion. In our model, instead of\ndescribing a continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) of a system of massive\nparticles as proposed by Ghirardi, Pearle and Rimini, the It\\^{o} stochastic\nequation accounts for the intervention of the CBR on the system of particles.\nEssentially, this approach leads to a pre-master equation for both the CBR and\nparticles degrees of freedom. The violation of the principle of energy\nconservation characteristic of the CSL model is avoided as well as the\nadditional assumption on the size of the GRWP's localization width necessary to\nreach the decoupling between the collective and internal motions. Moreover,\nrealistic estimation for the decoherence time, exhibiting an interesting\ndependence on the CBR temperature, is obtained. From the formula for the\ndecoherence time it is possible to analyze the transition from micro to macro\ndynamics in both the early hot Universe and the nowadays cold one. The entropy\nof the system under decoherence is analyzed and the emergent `pointer basis' is\ndiscussed. In spite of not having imposed a privileged basis, in our model the\nposition still emerges as the preferred observable as in the CSL model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2000 04:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
