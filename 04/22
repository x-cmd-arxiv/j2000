The study of\nalternating sums leads to a tower of experimental results involving\npolylogarithms in the golden ratio.

Analytical calculations of the dressed-state structure and Monte\nCarlo wave-function simulations of the system dynamics show that, for a\nsuitably chosen cavity detuning, it is possible to generate states of photon\nmultiplets that are maximally entangled in polarization. These states display\nnonclassical correlations of the type described by Greenberger, Horne, and\nZeilinger (GHZ). An experimental scheme to realize a GHZ measurement using\ncoincidence detection of the photons escaping from the cavity is proposed. The\ncorrelations are found to originate in the dynamics of the adiabatic passage\nand persist even if cavity decay and GHZ state synthesis compete on the same\ntime scale. Beyond entangled field states, it is also possible to generate\nentanglement between photons and the atom by using a different atomic\ntransition and initial Zeeman state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Apr 2000 00:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
