The inability to sufficiently\nconstrain galaxy mass models results in large uncertainties on the derived\n$H_o$, and severely hampers the cosmological application of this otherwise\nelegant method. At the same time, lensing must compete with new techniques that\nhave the potential to measure the Hubble constant to within a few percent by\nthe middle of the decade. In this letter we re-evaluate the role of strong\ngravitational lensing in the age of precision cosmology, and present a series\nof Monte Carlo simulations that demonstrate the effect of the galaxy mass\ndistribution on Hubble constant determination. Though most gravitational lens\nsystems are unlikely to contribute significantly to precision studies of the\ncosmological distance scale, the strong dependence of predicted time delays on\nthe galaxy mass profile suggests that the most useful and interesting results\nmay be obtained by running the traditional lensing problem in reverse --\nnamely, combining measured time delays with a well-constrained value of $H_o$\nto study galaxy mass distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2000 22:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We test this hypothesis by comparing the nuclear spectra of\n105 bright nearby galaxies with measurements of their R or r band morphological\nasymmetries at three successive radii. We find no significant differences in\nthese asymmetries between the 13 Seyfert galaxies in the sample and galaxies\nhaving other nuclear spectral types (absorption, H II-region like, LINER), nor\nis there strong qualitative evidence that such mergers have occured among any\nof the Seyferts or LINERs.

Support for the latter interpretation\nis provided by the growing evidence that supermassive black holes exist in the\ncores of most elliptical and early-type spiral galaxies, which in turn suggests\nthat nuclear activity represents a normal phase in the evolution of the bulges\nof massive galaxies.

The mass transfer\nvariation has been derived from 20 years of visual monitoring and from X-ray\nobservations covering various accretion states of the discless cataclysmic\nvariable AM Herculis. We find that the outburst behaviour of a fictitious dwarf\nnova with the same system parameters as AM Her is strongly influenced by these\nvariations of the mass loss rate. Depending on the mass loss rate, the disc\nproduces either long outbursts, a cycle of one long outburst followed by two\nshort outbursts, or only short outbursts. The course of the transfer rate\ndominates the shape of the outbursts because the mass accreted during an\noutburst cycle roughly equals the mass transferred from the secondary over the\noutburst interval. Only for less than 10% of the simulated time, when the mass\ntransfer rate is nearly constant, the disc is in a quasi-stationary state\nduring which it periodically repeats the same cycle of outbursts. Consequently,\nassuming that the secondary stars in non-magnetic CV's do not differ from those\nin magnetic ones, our simulation indicates that probably all dwarf novae are\nrarely in a stationary state and are constantly adjusting to the prevailing\nvalue of the mass transfer rate from the secondary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2000 15:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This mechanism is connected with the existence of a\nnarrow, roughly half-filled \"superconducting energy band\" of given symmetry.\nThe special symmetry of the superconducting band was interpreted within a\nnonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model of magnetism. Within this\nnonadiabatic Heisenberg model, the electrons of the superconducting band are\nconstrained to form Cooper pairs at zero temperature because in any normal\nconducting state the conservation of crystal-spin angular momentum would be\nviolated. Except for this participation of the angular momentum, the pair\nformation is mediated in the familiar way by phonons. Superconducting bands can\nbe identified even within a free-electron band structure. Therefore, in this\npaper the band structures of the bcc and hcp solid solution alloys composed of\ntransition elements are approximated by appropriate free-electron band\nstructures with s-d symmetry. From the free-electron bands, the number n of\nvalence electrons per atom related to the maxima of the superconducting\ntransition temperature Tc in these solid solutions is calculated within the\nnonadiabatic Heisenberg model.

Physical principles\nshould have been both constraints and guide-lines for the evolution of living\nsystems over billions of years. One generally aims at clarifying what physical\nprinciples, possibly new ones, are behind the phenomena of biological interest\nand at understanding how they work within the entire biological world. In the\npresent talk we describe an example of such an effort.\n  Since the discovery of `superprecipitation' by Szent-Gyorgyi's group in\n1940's, it has been a long puzzle how an assemblage of actin filaments with\nrandom orientation can contract in the presence of the two-headed myosin\nmolecules undergoing actin-activated ATP-hydrolysis reaction. It is widely\naccepted that during the contraction the two-headed myosin mediates the\nrelative sliding of two actin filaments whose polarity directions are not\nparallel but rather anti-parallel. But this fact solely does not account for\nthe shortening. We propose a dynamical model which, upon numerical simulation,\nexhibits the shortening of an bundle of the actin filaments which are initially\ndirstributed randomly both in space along a line and in polarity direction. In\nthe course of shortening several clusters of actins appears along the bundle.\nThe model also shows the sorting of the actin filaments according to their\npolarity in the late stage. These findings are in accordance with the recent\nexperiment by Takiguchi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2000 14:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Nonclassical features emerge as photon number quantization is\nresolved. In particular, a strong anti-correlation of quantization and\ncoherence is observable in QND measurements of photon number, and a correlation\nbetween measurement induced quantum jumps and quadrature component measurement\nresults is obtained in QND measurements of quadrature fluctuations in the\nphoton vacuum. Such nonclassical correlations represent fundamental quantum\nproperties of the light field and may provide new insights into the nature of\nquantization itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2000 05:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
