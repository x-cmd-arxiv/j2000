The transition between superconductivity and\nantiferromagnetism occurs through a phase where both order parameters coexist\nwith a third, dynamically generated, spin-triplet amplitude. This dynamical\ngeneration of a new order parameter is not restricted to a system with\nantiferromagnetism and d-wave superconductivity, but is a generic feature for\nfermionic systems. The dynamically generated spin-triplet order parameter is\nfound to be robust to variations in the mean-field Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2000 15:21:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Jul 2000 14:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

In essence, an RSLD derivation is\nan SLD derivation such that redundancy elimination from resolvents is performed\nafter each rewriting step. It is intuitive that redundancy elimination may have\npositive effects on derivation process. However, undesiderable effects are also\npossible. In particular, as shown in this paper, program termination as well as\ncompleteness of loop checking mechanisms via a given selection rule may be\nlost. The study of such effects has led us to an analysis of selection rule\nbasic concepts, so that we have found convenient to move the attention from\nrules of atom selection to rules of atom scheduling. A priority mechanism for\natom scheduling is built, where a priority is assigned to each atom in a\nresolvent, and primary importance is given to the event of arrival of new atoms\nfrom the body of the applied clause at rewriting time. This new computational\nmodel proves able to address the study of redundancy elimination effects,\ngiving at the same time interesting insights into general properties of\nselection rules. As a matter of fact, a class of scheduling rules, namely the\nspecialisation independent ones, is defined in the paper by using not trivial\nsemantic arguments. As a quite surprising result, specialisation independent\nscheduling rules turn out to coincide with a class of rules which have an\nimmediate structural characterisation (named stack-queue rules). Then we prove\nthat such scheduling rules are tolerant to redundancy elimination, in the sense\nthat neither program termination nor completeness of equality loop check is\nlost passing from SLD to RSLD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2000 13:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nstudy the relaxation rate of the order parameter in an O(N) scalar theory near\nthe critical point to model the non-equilibrium dynamics of critical\nfluctuations near the chiral phase transition.A lowest order perturbative\ncalculation (two loops in the coupling lambda) reveals the breakdown of\nperturbation theory for long-wavelength fluctuations in the critical region and\nthe emergence of a hierarchy of scales with hard q>T, semisoft T >> q >> lambda\nT and soft lambda T>>q loop momenta which are widely separated for weak\ncoupling. The non-perturbative resummation in the large N limit reveals the\nrenormalization of the interaction and the crossover to an effective 3D-theory\nfor soft momenta.The effective 3D coupling goes to the Wilson-Fisher 3D fixed\npoint in the soft limit.The relaxation rate of the order parameter for wave\nvectors lambda T >>k>> k_{us} or near the critical temperature lambda\nT>>m_T>>k_{us} with the ultra soft scale k_{us} = [(lambda T)/(4pi)]\nexp[-(4pi/lambda)] is dominated by classical semisoft loop momentum leading to\nGamma(k,T) = lambda T/(2 pi N). For wavectors k<< k_{us} the damping rate is\ndominated by hard loop momenta and given by Gamma(k,T)=4 pi T/[3N ln(T/k)].\nAnalogously, for homogeneous fluctuations in the ultracritical region\nm_T<<k_{us} the damping rate is given by Gamma_0(m_T,T)=4 pi T/[3N ln(T/m_T)].\nThus critical slowing down emerges for ultrasoft fluctuations where the rate is\nlambda-independent. The strong coupling regime and the shortcomings of the\nquasiparticle interpretation are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2000 10:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It turns out that this problem is\nclosely related to the question of stability of the trivial solution for the\nmodel problem $\\partial_t u(x,t) = \\partial_x^2 u\n(x,t)+(1+\\tanh(x-ct))u(x,t)+u(x,t)^p$ with $p>3$. In particular, we show that\nthe instability of the perturbation ahead of the front is entirely compensated\nby a diffusive stabilization which sets in once the perturbation has hit the\nbulk behind the front.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2000 14:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Both the BCS as well as number-projected\nsolutions of the model are presented. For the latter case the Lipkin-Nogami\nprojection technique was extended to encompass the case of non-separable\nproton-neutron systems. The influence of the projection on various pairing\nphases is discussed. In particular, it is shown that number-projection allows\nfor mixing of different pairing phases but, simultanously, acts destructively\non the proton-neutron correlations. The basic implications of proton-neutron\npairing correlations on nuclear masses are discussed. It is shown that these\ncorrelations may provide a natural microscopic explanation of the Wigner energy\nlacking in mean-field models. A possible phase transition from isovector to\nisoscalar pairing condensate at high angular momenta is also discussed. In\nparticular predictions for the dynamical moments of inertia for the\nsuperdeformed band in $^{88}$Ru are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2000 15:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
