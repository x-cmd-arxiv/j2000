The\nfate of such a bar-shaped star is uncertain. Some previous numerical studies\nindicate that the bar is short lived, lasting for only a few bar-rotation\nperiods, while other studies suggest that the bar is relatively long lived.\nThis paper contains the results of a numerical simulation of a rapidly rotating\ngamma=5/3 fluid star. The simulation shows that the bar shape is long lived:\nonce the bar is established, the star retains this shape for more than 10\nbar-rotation periods, through the end of the simulation. The results are\nconsistent with the conjecture that a star will retain its bar shape\nindefinitely on a dynamical time scale, as long as its rotation rate exceeds\nthe threshold for secular bar instability. The results are described in terms\nof a low density neutron star, but can be scaled to represent, for example, a\nburned-out stellar core that is prevented from complete collapse by centrifugal\nforces. Estimates for the gravitational-wave signal indicate that a dynamically\nunstable neutron star in our galaxy can be detected easily by the first\ngeneration of ground based gravitational-wave detectors.

The\n$\\Delta(1232)$ degrees of freedom are incorporated in a way consistent with\nboth, electromagnetic gauge invariance and invariance under contact\ntransformations. The model also includes the initial and final state\nrescattering of hadrons via a T-matrix with off-shell effects. The $\\pi N\n\\gamma$ differential cross sections are calculated using three different\nT-matrix models and the results are compared with the soft photon\napproximation, and with experimental data. The aim of this analysis is to test\nthe off-shell behavior of the different T-matrices under consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2000 22:27:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Additionally, the Ikeda sum rule for Fermi transitions is violated due\nto the lack of scattering terms in the phonon operators.
