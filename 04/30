Here, we revisit the\nglobular cluster system of the dE,N galaxy NGC 3115 DW1 - a companion of the\nnearby S0 galaxy NGC 3115 - adding Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and HST/WFPC2 imaging\nto previous ground-based photometry. Spectra for seven globular clusters reveal\nnormal abundance ratios with respect to the Milky Way and M31 clusters, as well\nas a relatively high mean metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.0+/-0.1 dex). Crude\nkinematics indicate a high velocity dispersion within 10 kpc which could either\nbe caused by dark matter dominated outer regions, or by the stripping of outer\nglobular clusters by the nearby giant galaxy NGC 3115. The total galaxy mass\nout to 3 and 10 kpc lies between 10^10 and 10^11 solar masses and 2*10^10 and\n4*10^11 solar masses, respectively, depending on the mass estimator used and\nthe assumptions on cluster orbits and systemic velocity. The HST imaging allows\nmeasurement of sizes for two clusters, returning core radii around 2.0 pc,\nsimilar to the sizes observed in other galaxies. Spectroscopy allows an\nestimate of the degree of contamination by foreground stars or background\ngalaxies for the previous ground-based photometry, but does not require a\nrevision of previous results: NGC 3115 DW1 hosts around 60+/-20 clusters which\ncorresponds to a specific frequency of 4.9+/-1.9, on the high end for massive\ndEs. Given its absolute magnitude (M_V=-17.7 mag) and the properties of its\ncluster system, NGC 3115 DW1 appears to be a transition between a luminous dE\nand low-luminosity E galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2000 16:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We show that the low-order clustering statistics of\nthe dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations and\ndensity profiles of dark-matter haloes. A hypothetical galaxy catalogue depends\non (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupation\nnumber -- the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in a\nhalo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo.\nThe first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups.\nFor the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, with\nany remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. These\nsimple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which the\nprobability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local mass\ndensity. We have applied this prescription to some CDM models of current\ninterest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxy\ncorrelations for a flat $\\Omega=0.3$ model ($\\Lambda$CDM), but not for an\n$\\Omega=1$ model with the same power spectrum ($\\tau$CDM). This is an\ninevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra:\ncluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high $\\Omega$,\nand hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. Finally, the pairwise\nvelocity dispersion of galaxies in the $\\Lambda$CDM model is lower than that of\nthe mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic Mach number\nfor the peculiar velocity field. This is largely due to the strong variation of\ngalaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2000 21:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2000 12:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}
