Rotating protogalaxies gather matter from the central gaseous region\nleading to the birth of massive toroidal stars whose internal nuclear reactions\nproceed very rapidly. Once the nuclear fuel is spent, gravitational collapse\nproduces a slender ring-shaped TBH remnant. These events are typically the\nfirst supernovae of the host galaxies. Given time the TBH mass increases\nthrough continued accretion by several orders of magnitude, the event horizon\nswells whilst the central aperture shrinks. The difference in angular\nvelocities between the accreting matter and the TBH induces a magnetic field\nthat is strongest in the region of the central aperture and innermost\nergoregion. Due to the presence of negative energy states when such a\ngravitational vortex is immersed in an electromagnetic field, circumstances are\nnear ideal for energy extraction via non-thermal radiation including the\nPenrose process and superradiant scattering. This establishes a self-sustaining\nmechanism whereby the transport of angular momentum away from the quasar by\nrelativistic bi-directional jets reinforces both the modulating magnetic field\nand the TBH/accretion disk angular velocity differential. Quasar behaviour is\nextinguished once the BH topology becomes spheroidal. Similar mechanisms may be\noperating in microquasars, SNe and GRBs when neutron density or BH tori arise.\nIn certain circumstances, long-term TBH stability can be maintained by a\nnegative cosmological constant, otherwise the classical topology theorems must\nsomehow be circumvented.
