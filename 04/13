The data consist of 19 high\nsignal-to-noise ratio optical templates, a result of grouping 185 emission line\ngalaxy spectra.

We analyse the\ndistribution of these improved signal-to-noise ratio emission spectra in\ndiagnostic diagrams and find that the HII templates show a smaller spread in\nlog([OIII]/H\\beta) values than the individual galaxies, apparently due to the\npopulation subtraction and better signal-to-noise ratio. We thus suggest the\ntemplate sequence as a fiducial observational locus for HII galaxies which can\nbe used as reference for models. The sequence of line ratios presented by the\nHII galaxies in the diagram log([OIII}]\\lambda5007/H\\beta) X\nlog([NII]\\lambda6584/H\\alpha) is primarily due to the gas metallicity, of which\nthe log([NII]/H\\alpha) ratio is a direct estimator.

This allows the excess to be determined in each week\nof the DIRBE mission for high redundancy, but the results depend weakly on the\nIPD model. Both methods give consistent results at 60 and 100 microns. The\nobserved signal is consistent with an isotropic background at the level \\nu\nI_\\nu = 28.1 +- 1.8 +- 7(syst) nW/m^2/sr at 60 microns and 24.6 +- 2.5 +- 8\nnW/m^2/sr at 100 microns.\n  The IR excess detected at 140 and 240 microns by these methods agrees with\nprevious measurements, which are thought to be the cosmic infra-red background\n(CIB). The detections at 60 and 100 microns are new. While this new excess is\nnot necessarily the CIB, we have ruled out all known sources of emission in the\nsolar system and Galaxy. We therefore tentatively interpret this signal as the\nCIB and consider the implications of such energy production from the viewpoint\nof star formation efficiency and black hole accretion efficiency. However, the\nIR excess exceeds limits on the CIB derived from the inferred opacity of the\nIGM to observed TeV photons, thus casting doubt on this interpretation. There\nis currently no satisfactory explanation for the 60-100 micron excess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2000 23:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

An interesting\nproperty of the system is the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state\nleading to finite zero-temperature entropy. In our equilibrium study we\nconsider the effect of softening the spins. We show that the degeneracy of the\nground state is lifted and there is a qualitative change in the low temperature\nbehaviour of the system with a well defined low temperature peak of the\nspecific heat that carries the thermodynamic ``weight'' of the ground state\nentropy. In our study of the dynamical properties, the stochastic Kawasaki\ndynamics is considered. The Fokker-Planck operator for the process corresponds\nto a quantum spin Hamiltonian similar to the Heisenberg ferromagnet but with\nconstraints on allowed states. This leads to a number of differences in its\nproperties which are obtained through exact numerical diagonalization,\nsimulations and by obtaining various analytic bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2000 06:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
