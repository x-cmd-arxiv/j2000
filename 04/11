A temperature increase, e.g. in active regions, not only increases\nthe sound speed but also lengthens the path along which the wave travels\nbecause the expansion of the heated layers shifts the upper turning of the\nwaves upward. Using a ray tracing approximation we find that in many cases the\nnet effect of a temperature enhancement is an {\\it increase} of the travel\ntimes. We argue that the reduced travel times that are observed are caused by a\ncombination of magnetic fields in the active region and {\\it reduced}\nsubsurface temperatures.

Earlier evidence of a soft excess in Mrk 509 is confirmed. This\nexcess is found to be better represented by a power law than by a black body:\nwith a photon slope of 2.5, its extrapolation matches the flux recorded in the\nfar UV. An ASCA observation, which appeared to exclude the presence of the\nexcess while showing instead evidence of a warm absorber, turns out to be\ncompatible with the coexistence of the excess seen with BeppoSAX and of the\nwarm absorber. The hard power law of Mrk 509 is seen for the first time to be\naffected by a cut-off at high energies, with an e-folding energy of about 70\nkeV. In MCG+8-11-11 the cut-off is found at about 170 keV, consistent within\nthe combined errors with a previous estimate from a ASCA+OSSE/CGRO observation.\nIn both objects the reflection component is clearly detected. In Mrk 509 its\nstrength, together with that of the iron K line, indicates a solid angle Omega,\nsubtended by the reprocessing gas in the accretion disk, much less than 2pi,\nbut lacking a valid constraint on the inclination angle this evidence is not as\nconvincing as that found with BeppoSAX in IC 4329A. In MCG+8-11-11 the same\nparameters are instead consistent with Omega=2pi, but the comparison with an\nASCA observation, when the flux level was about 2.5 times weaker, suggests that\na substantial fraction of the angle might be associated with gas farther out\nthan the accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2000 11:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Due to the wide range of Balmer line strengths observed,\nellipticals have been interpreted to exhibit an appreciable scatter in age. In\nthis paper, we analyze Composite Stellar Population models with a simple mix of\nan old metal-rich and an old metal-poor component. We show that these models\nsimultaneously produce strong Balmer lines and strong metallic lines without\ninvoking a young population. The key to this result is that our models are\nbased on SSPs that better match the steep increase of Hbeta in metal-poor\nglobular clusters than models in the literature. Hence, the scatter of Hbeta\nobserved in cluster and luminous field elliptical galaxies can be explained by\na spread in the metallicity of old stellar populations. We check our model with\nrespect to the so-called G-dwarf problem in ellipticals. For a galaxy subsample\ncovering a large range in UV-V colors we demonstrate that the addition of an\nold metal-poor subcomponent does not invalidate other observational constraints\nlike colors and the flux in the mid-UV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2000 15:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}

We find two critical points at U = $U_c$ and U =\n$U_s$ that separate the BI and MI phases for a given V. A charge-neutral\nspin-singlet exciton band develops in the BI phase (U<$U_c$) and drops below\nthe band gap when U exceeds a special point Ue. The exciton gap closes at the\nfirst critical point $U_c$ while the charge and spin gaps persist and coincide\nbetween $U_c$<U<$U_s$ where the system is dimerized. Both the charge and spin\ngaps collapse at U = $U_s$ when the transition to the MI phase occurs. In the\nMI phase (U>$U_s$) the charge gap increases almost linearly with U while the\nspin gap remains zero.

The question arises whether such effects could be observed\nwith extremely weak pulses, and what would prevent the observation of an\n\"optical tachyon.\" Aharonov, Reznik, and Stern (ARS) [Phys. Rev. Lett., vol.\n81, 2190 (1998)] have argued that quantum noise will preclude the observation\nof a superluminal group velocity when the pulse consists of one or a few\nphotons. In this paper we reconsider this question both in a general framework\nand in the specific example, suggested by Chiao, Kozhekin, and Kurizki [Phys.\nRev. Lett., vol. 77, 1254 (1996)], of off-resonant, short-pulse propagation in\nan optical amplifier. We derive in the case of the amplifier a signal-to-noise\nratio that is consistent with the general ARS conclusions when we impose their\ncriteria for distinguishing between superluminal propagation and propagation at\nthe speed c. However, results consistent with the semiclassical arguments of\nCKK are obtained if weaker criteria are imposed, in which case the signal can\nexceed the noise without being \"exponentially large.\" We show that the quantum\nfluctuations of the field considered by ARS are closely related to\nsuperfluorescence noise. More generally we consider the implications of\nunitarity for superluminal propagation and quantum noise and study, in addition\nto the complete and truncated wavepackets considered by ARS, the residual\nwavepacket formed by their difference. This leads to the conclusion that the\nnoise is mostly luminal and delayed with respect to the superluminal signal. In\nthe limit of a very weak incident signal pulse, the superluminal signal will be\ndominated by the noise part, and the signal-to-noise ratio will therefore be\nvery small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2000 16:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
