The dyadosphere,\nthe region in which a super critical field exists for the creation of\nelectron-positron pairs, is here considered in the special case of a\nReissner-Nordstrom geometry. The interaction of the PEM pulse with the baryonic\nmatter is described using a simplified model of a slab of constant thickness in\nthe laboratory frame (constant-thickness approximation) as well as performing\nthe integration of the general relativistic hydrodynamical equations.

Within this\nnonadiabatic Heisenberg model, the electrons of the superconducting band form\nCooper pairs at zero temperature.

There is great evidence that these constraining forces\nare responsible for superconducting eigenstates.

The existence of consistent\ntruncations implies that the massive modes decouple, and gauged supergravity is\nsufficient for computing n-point functions of CFT operators coupled to the\nmassless (sugra) sector. The action obtained from the linear ansatz, of the\ntype $\\phi(x,y)=\\phi_I(x)Y^I(y)$ gives only part of the gauged sugra. This\nmeans that there is a difference for the correlators on the boundary of AdS\nspace. We find, studying examples of correlators, that the right prescription\nis to use the full gauged sugra, which implies using the full nonlinear KK\nansatz. To this purpose, we analyze 3 point functions of various gauge fields\nin 5 and 7 dimensions, and the R-current anomaly in the corresponding CFT. We\nalso show that the nonlinear rotation in the tower of scalar fields of Lee et\nal., Corrado et al. and Bastianelli and Zucchini produces a consistent\ntruncation to the massless level and coincides with the Taylor expansion of the\nnonlinear KK ansatz in massless scalar fluctuations. Finally, we speculate\nabout the way to do the full nonlinear rotation for the massive tower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2000 19:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Basic equation of this model\ncontains traditional logarithmic term and a non-traditional parabolic term. At\nisolated equilibrium the non-traditional term equals to zero turning the whole\nequation to the traditional form of constant equation. This term coincides with\nthe excessive thermodynamic function revealing linear relationship between\nlogarithm of the thermodynamic activity coefficient and reaction extent at open\nequilibrium. Discovered relationship prompts us to use in many systems a\ncombination of the linearity coefficient and reaction shift from true\nequilibrium rather then activity coefficients. The coefficient of linearity can\nbe found by thermodynamic computer simulation while the shift is an independent\nvariable defining the open equilibrium state. Numerical data obtained by\nvarious simulation techniques proved premise of the method of chemical\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2000 08:18:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 May 2000 07:06:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 May 2000 10:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In CSL, the usual Schr\\\"odinger dynamics is altered so that a\nrandomly fluctuating classical field interacts with quantized particles to\ncause wavefunction collapse. In this paper it is shown how to define energy for\nthe classical field so that the average value of the energy of the field plus\nthe quantum system {\\it is} conserved for the ensemble of collapsing\nwavefunctions. While conservation of just the first moment of energy is, of\ncourse, much less than complete conservation of energy, this does support the\nidea that the field could provide the conservation law balance when events\noccur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2000 19:05:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2000 14:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}
