New IRAS 60$\\mu m$ fluxes are obtained\nusing the SCANPI/SUPERSCANPI software at the new ISOCAM positions of the\nsources in the sample. It is found to be in excellent agreement with the 15$\\mu\nm$ local luminosity function published by Xu et al (1998), which is derived\nfrom the {\\it predicted} 15$\\mu m$ luminosities of a sample of IRAS 25$\\mu m$\nselected galaxies. Model predictions of number counts and redshift\ndistributions based on the local luminosity function and assumptions of its\nevolution with the redshift are calculated and compared with the data of ISOCAM\n15$\\mu m$ surveys. Strong luminosity evolution on the order of $L\\propto\n(1+z)^{4.5}$ is suggested in these comparisons, while pure density evolution\ncan be ruled out with high confidence. The sharp peak at about 0.4mJy in the\nEuclidean normalized differential counts at 15$\\mu m$ can be explained by the\neffects of MIR broadband emission features, eliminating the need for any\nhypothesis for a 'new population'. It is found that the contribution from the\npopulation represented by ISOCAM 15$\\mu m$ sources can account for the entire\nIR/submm background, leaving little room for any missing 'new population' which\ncan be significant energy sources of the IR/submm sky.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2000 23:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
