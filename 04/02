Dipole\napproximation is assumed. The dual Dyson series, here discussed by referring it\nto the Birkhoff theorem for singularly perturbed linear differential equations,\ncan be applied and a perturbation series obtained transforming the Hamiltonian\nby a Pauli-Fierz transformation. But, if just few photons are present\nhigh-order harmonics cannot be generated. So, it is proven that odd high-order\nharmonics only appear when the laser field is intense and one can substitute\nthe creation and annihilation operators by the square root of the mean number\nof photons taken to be huge, the field retaining its coherency property as\nobserved experimentally for harmonics. In this case, the Hamiltonian for\nperturbation theory comes to the Kramers-Henneberger form. The theory has a\ndipolar contribution when the free-electron quiver motion amplitude is larger\nthan the atomic radius. For a Coulomb potential one has that the outer electron\nis periodically kicked, and so a prove is given that the same should happen to\nRydberg atoms in intense microwave fields. The distribution representing the\nkicking has a Fourier series with just odd terms. Using a modified\nRayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger perturbation theory, it is shown that under the same\ncondition of validity of the quiver motion amplitude to atomic radius ratio,\nthe atomic wave function is only slightly modified by the laser field due to\nthe way the energy levels rearrange themselves.
