In the low-frequency shoulder,\nthe luminosity can be up to two orders of magnitude greater than with a purely\nthermal plasma even if only a small fraction (< 1%) of the steady-state\nelectron energy is in the non-thermal electrons. We apply the hybrid model to\nthe Galactic center source, Sgr A*. The observed radio and IR spectra imply\nthat at most 1% of the steady-state electron energy is present in a power-law\ntail in this source. This corresponds to no more than 10% of the electron\nenergy injected into the non-thermal electrons and hence 90% into the thermal\nelectrons.

A fast rotation is enhancing the mass loss by\nstellar winds and reciprocally high mass loss is removing a lot of angular\nmomentum. The problem of the ``break-up'' or $\\Omega$-limit is critically\nexamined in connection with the origin of Be and LBV stars. The effects of\nrotation on the tracks in the HR diagram, the lifetimes, the isochrones, the\nblue to red supergiant ratios, the formation of W-R stars, the chemical\nabundances in massive stars as well as in red giants and AGB stars, are\nreviewed in relation to recent observations for stars in the Galaxy and\nMagellanic Clouds. The effects of rotation on the final stages and on the\nchemical yields are examined, as well as the constraints placed by the periods\nof pulsars. On the whole, this review points out that stellar evolution is not\nonly a function of mass M and metallicity Z, but of angular velocity $\\Omega$\nas well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2000 14:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

It is shown that these constraints imply a\ncertain structure for the in-medium hadron correlators and lead to the\ncancelation of the order $\\rho m_\\pi$ term in the in-medium nucleon correlator.\nWe also consider the effect of mixing of the chiral partners correlation\nfunctions arising from the interaction of nuclear pions with corresponding\ninterpolating currents. It reflects the phenomena of partial restoration of\nchiral symmetry. The different scenarios of such restoration are briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2000 13:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

A starting point for systematic treatments of\necological and evolutionary phenomena has been provided by the gene centered\nview of evolution which assigns effective fitness to each allele instead of\neach organism. The gene centered view can be formalized as a dynamic mean field\napproximation applied to genes in reproduction / selection dynamics. We show\nthat the gene centered view breaks down for symmetry breaking and pattern\nformation within a population; and show that spatial distributions of organisms\nwith local mating neighborhoods in the presence of disruptive selection give\nrise to such symmetry breaking and pattern formation in the genetic composition\nof local populations. Global dynamics follows conventional coarsening of\nsystems with nonconserved order parameters. The results have significant\nimplications for the ecology of genetic diversity and species formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2000 16:57:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2000 19:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

Newtonian\nInertia is a property of matter due to the strictly local electrical force\ninteractions contributed by each of the (electrically charged) elementary\nparticles of the mass with the surrounding (electrically charged) virtual\nparticles (virtual masseons) of the quantum vacuum. The sum of all the tiny\nelectrical forces (photon exchanges with the vacuum particles) originating in\neach charged elementary particle of the accelerated mass is the source of the\ntotal inertial force of a mass which opposes accelerated motion in Newton's law\n'F = MA'. We found that gravity also involves the same 'inertial'\nelectromagnetic force component that exists in inertial mass. We propose that\nEinstein's general relativistic Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP) originates\nfrom common 'lower level' quantum vacuum processes occurring in both inertial\nmass and gravitational mass, in accordance with the principles of quantum field\ntheory. Gravitational mass results from the quantum activities of both the\nelectrical force (photon exchanges) component and the pure gravitational force\n(graviton exchanges) component, acting simultaneously on the elementary\nparticles that make up a mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2000 15:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
