We propose that the orbital\nordering of a novel type may exist in such situation: there may occur ferro\norbital ordering of complex orbitals (linear superposition of basic orbitals\nd_x^2-y^2 and d_z^2 with complex coefficients). Despite the perfect orbital\nordering, such state still retains cubic symmetry and thus would not induce any\nstructural distortion. This novel state can resolve many problems in the\nphysics of CMR manganites and can also exist in other doped Mott insulators\nwith Jahn-Teller ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2000 08:57:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2000 16:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

It is shown that the transition of HTS from\ninsulator to metal passes through the particular dopant concentration range\nwhere the local transfer of singlet electron pairs from oxygen ions to pairs of\nneighboring cations (-U centers) are allowed while the single-electron\ntransitions are still forbidden. We believe it is this concentration range that\ncorresponds to the region of high-Tc superconductivity and the interelectron\nattraction results from the interaction of electron pairs with -U centers.\nAdditional hole carriers are generated as the result of singlet electron pair\ntransitions from oxygen ions to -U-centers. The orbitals of the arising singlet\nhole pairs are localized in the nearest vicinity of -U center. In such a system\nthe hole conductivity starts up at the dopant concentration exceeding the\nclassical 2D-percolation threshold for singlet hole pair orbitals.

These effects came about when one applies the Second Relativity\nPostulate to inertial observers. Here I demonstrate that there is a very\nelegant way of explaining how exactly nature enforces Special Relativity, which\ncompels us to conclude that Einstein's great theory has already revealed\nquantization of space and time. The model proposes that microscopically the\nstructure of space-time is analogous to a crystal which consists of lattice\npoints or `tickmarks' (for measurements) connected by identical `elastic\nsprings'. When at rest the `springs' are at their natural states. When set in\nmotion and used to measure objects at rest, however, the lattice effectively\nvibrates in a manner described by Einstein's theory of the heat capacity of\nsolids, with consequent widening of the `tickmarks' because the\nroot-mean-square separation now increases.

A moving observer\nwho measures distances with such a vibrating lattice obtains results which are\nprecisely those given by the Lorentz transformation.
