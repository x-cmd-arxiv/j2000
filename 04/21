The observed flat behavior of N/O versus O/H in\nmetal-poor galaxies is explained by invoking low star formation rates which\nflatten the age-metallicity relation and thereby allow N/O to rise to observed\nlevels at low metallicities. The observed scatter and distribution of data\npoints for N/O challenge the popular idea that intermittent polluting by oxygen\nfrom massive stars is occurring following star bursts.

The\nlimiting factor has been the lack of large samples of galaxies (covering a wide\nrange in spectral type) with high signal-to-noise spectrophotometric\nobservations. To alleviate this problem we introduce here a new technique for\nreconstructing galaxy spectral energy distributions directly from samples of\ngalaxies with broadband photometric data and spectroscopic redshifts.\nExploiting the statistical approach of the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, our\niterative training procedure increasingly improves the eigenbasis, so that it\nprovides better agreement with the photometry. We demonstrate the utility of\nthis approach by applying these improved spectral energy distributions to the\nestimation of photometric redshifts for the HDF sample of galaxies.
