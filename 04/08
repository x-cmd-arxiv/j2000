The VLA 8.5-GHz difference light curve of\nthe lensed images, taking the proper time-delay into account, shows the\npresence of external variability with 14.6-sigma confidence. We investigate two\nplausible causes of this external variability: scattering by the ionized\ncomponent of the Galactic interstellar medium and microlensing by massive\ncompact objects in the bulge/disk and halo of the lens galaxy. Based on the\ntight relation between the modulation-index and variability time scale and the\nquantitative difference between the light curves of both lensed images, we\nconclude that the observed short-term variability characteristics of the lensed\nimages are incompatible with scintillation in our Galaxy. This conclusion is\nstrongly supported by multi-frequency WSRT observations at 1.4 and 5 GHz, which\nare in strong disagreement with predictions based on the scintillation\nhypothesis. ... On the other hand, a single superluminal jet-component, having\nan apparent velocity 9<=(v_app/c)<=26, a radius of 2-5 micro-arcsec and\ncontaining 5-11% of the observed 8.5-GHz source flux density, can reproduce the\nobserved modulation-indices and variability time scale at 8.5 GHz, when it is\nmicrolensed by compact objects in the lens galaxy. It also reproduces the\nfrequency-dependence of the modulation-indices, determined from the independent\nWSRT 1.4 and 5-GHz observations. ... The only conclusion fully consistent with\nthe data gathered thus far is that we have indeed detected radio microlensing.\nThe far reaching consequence of this statement is that a significant fraction\nof the mass in the dark-matter halo at ~6 kpc (h=0.65) above the lens-galaxy\ndisk in B1600+434 consists of massive compact objects.

The mean luminosity of the bright BGCs\ndecreases by 0.2 mag with increasing galactocentric radius over the range of 9\narcmin, while that of the RGCs does not. The observed color distribution of\nthese globular clusters is distinctively bimodal with peaks at (V-I) = 0.98 and\n1.23.

The parametric dependence of the\nzero-temperature gap on the coupling constant differs in QCD from that in BCS\ntheory. On the other hand, the transition temperature to the superconducting\nphase is related to the zero-temperature gap in the same way in QCD as in BCS\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2000 22:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Application of the\nLorentz Transformation to (i) shows that such objects, observed from the\nstationary frame with coarse time resolution in a direction perpendicular to\ntheir direction of motion are seen to be at rest but {\\it longer} in the\ndirection of the relative velocity $\\vec{v}$ by a factor $1/\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}$\n(Space Dilatation) and to (ii) that the moving equivalent clock at any fixed\nposition in the rest frame of the stationary observer is seen to be running\n{\\it faster} than a similar clock at rest by the factor $1/\\sqrt{1-(v/c)^2}$\n(Time Contraction). All four space-time `effects' of Special Relativity are\nsimply classified in terms of the projective geometry of space-time, and the\nclose analogy of these effects to linear spatial perspective is pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2000 08:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
