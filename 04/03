A one loop renormalization group analysis of\nthe effective action shows that for order parameter dimensions $p<4$ the rare\nregions destroy the conventional critical behavior. For order parameter\ndimensions $p>4$ the critical behavior is not influenced by the rare regions,\nit is described by the conventional dirty cubic fixed point. We also discuss\nthe influence of the rare regions on the fluctuation-driven first-order\ntransition in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2000 09:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Finally, we discuss the applicability of\nour method to phenomenologically relevant multi--loop calculations such as the\nNNLO QCD corrections for e^+e^- --> 3 jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2000 14:17:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2001 18:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We show that for an arbitrary background path the\nusual local form of the action is not preserved by the flow. To cure this\nproblem we consider a more general action than usual which is stable by the\nrenormalization group flow.
