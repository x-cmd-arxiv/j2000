It\ncreates a rather bleak eschatological picture. An ever-expanding universe's\nfuture appears to be increasingly dominated by its constant vacuum energy. A\nuniverse doomed to accelerate forever will produce a state of growing\nuniformity and cosmic loneliness. Structures participating in the cosmological\nexpansion will ultimately leave each others' horizons and\ninformation-processing must eventually die out. Here, we examine whether this\npicture is the only interpretation of the observations. We find that in many\nwell-motivated scenarios the observed spell of vacuum domination is only a\ntransient phenomenon. Soon after acceleration starts, the vacuum energy's\nanti-gravitational properties are reversed, and a matter-dominated decelerating\ncosmic expansion resumes. Thus, contrary to general expectations, once an\naccelerating universe does not mean always an accelerating universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2000 12:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

A major objective was to clarify the means by which free energy is\ntransferred and conserved in sequences of biological reactions coupled by\nfreely diffusible intermediates.
