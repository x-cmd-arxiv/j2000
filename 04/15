Moreover, selection effects in redshift\nare allowed. Furthermore the inclusion of additional observables correlated\nwith the absolute magnitude -- such as for example rotation velocity\ninformation as described by the Tully-Fisher relation -- is straightforward.\n  As an illustration of the method, the predicted IRAS peculiar velocity model\ncharacterised by the density parameter beta is tested on two samples.

An improved version of the related\nalgorithm for computation of Janet bases, initially designed by Zharkov, is\ndescribed. For an ideal with a finite Pommaret basis, the algorithm computes\nthis basis. Otherwise, the algorithm computes a Janet basis which need not be\nminimal. The obtained results are generalized to linear differential ideals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2000 08:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
