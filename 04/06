The soft X-ray spectrum <2keV is\ndominated by thermal emission from optically-thin plasma with kT~0.5keV. The\nhard X-ray emission is clearly due to a power-law component with photon index\nGamma=1.8 absorbed by a column density of N_H=8x10^22/cm^2. The power-law is\nreadily identified with primary X-ray emission from the AGN central engine. We\nalso clearly detect a narrow iron K-alpha emission line at 6.4keV. No broad\ncomponent is detected. We suggest that the bulk of this narrow line comes from\nthe accretion disk and, furthermore, that the power-law X-ray source which\nexcites this line emission (which is typically identified with a disk corona)\nmust be at least 100GM/c^2 in extent. This is in stark contrast to many\nhigher-luminosity Seyfert galaxies which display a broad iron line indicating a\nsmall 10 GM/c^2 X-ray emitting region.

The more\ninteresting issue concerning the mass function is certainly to probe its low\nmass end. However due to the source confusion, even if the distribution and the\nkinematics of the lenses are known, the estimation of the mass function is\nextremely biased at low masses. The blending due to the source confusion biases\nthe duration of the event, which in turn dramatically biases the estimation of\nthe mass of the lens. To overcome this problem we propose to use differential\nphotometry of the microlensing events obtained using the image subtraction\nmethod. Differential photometry is free of any bias due to blending, however\nthe drawback of differential photometry is that the baseline flux is unknown.\nIn this paper we will show that even without knowing the baseline flux, purely\ndifferential photometry allow to estimate the mass function without any biases.\nThe basis of the method is that taking the scalar product of the microlensing\nlight curves with a given function and taking its sum over all the microlensing\nevents is equivalent to project the mass function on another function. This\nmethod demonstrates that there is a direct correspondancy between the space of\nthe observations and the space of the mass function. Concerning the function to\nuse in order to project the observations, we show that the principal components\nof the light curves are an optimal set. To illustrate the method we simulate\nsets consistent with the microlensing experiments. By using 1000 of these\nsimulations, we show that for instance the exponent of the mass function can be\nreconstructed without any biases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2000 18:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We studied behavior of one- and two-\ndimensional cardiac tissue spatially homogenous in all respects, including APD\nrestitution and conduction velocity restitution, using the Beeler Reuter ion\nchannel model. We found that discordant alternans was initiated when spatial\ngradients of APD arose dynamically, such as from fixed rate pacing of a cable\nend (sinus node scenario), or from fixed rate pacing at one site preceded by a\nsingle excitation wavefront from another site (ectopic focus scenario). In the\nsinus node scenario, conduction velocity restitution was necessary to initiate\ndiscordant alternans. Alternating regimes of concordant and discordant\nalternans arose along the length of the cable, with regimes delimited by nodes\nof fixed APD. The number of observable nodes depended upon pacing rate and\ntissue length. Differences in beat to beat conduction velocity values at steady\nstate were small. In the ectopic focus scenario, variable conduction velocity\nwas not required for induction of discrodant alternans. In both scenarios,\nstability of node position was dependent upon electrotonic coupling. Other\nmathematical models produced qualitatively similar results. We conclude that\nspatial inhomogeneities of electrical restitution are not requiredd to produce\ndiscordant alternans; rather, discordant alternans can arise dynamicaly from\ninteraction of APD and conduction veolocity resstitution with single site\npacing, or from APD restitution alone in two site pacing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2000 20:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
