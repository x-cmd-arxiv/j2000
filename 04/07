Such behaviour might be expected if tides and ram\npressure strip off the gaseous envelopes that normally fuel star formation in\nspirals over a Hubble time. Combining these timescales with mass accretion\nhistories derived from N-body simulations of cluster formation in a Lambda-CDM\nuniverse, we reproduce the systematic differences observed in the color\ndistribution of cluster and field galaxies, as well as the strong suppression\nof star formation in cluster galaxies and its dependence on clustercentric\nradius. The simulations also indicate that a significant fraction of galaxies\nbeyond the virial radius of the cluster may have been within the main body of\nthe cluster in the past, a result that explains naturally why star formation in\nthe outskirts of clusters (and as far out as two virial radii) is\nsystematically suppressed relative to the field.

The method relies upon the observation that all\nrich clusters, at all redshifts observed so far, appear to have a red sequence\nof early-type galaxies. The emerging picture is that all rich clusters contain\na core population of passively evolving elliptical galaxies which are coeval\nand formed at high redshifts. The proposed search method exploits this strong\nempirical fact by using the red sequence as a direct indicator of overdensity.\nThe fundamental advantage of this approach is that with appropriate filters,\ncluster elliptical galaxies at a given redshift are redder than all normal\ngalaxies at lower redshifts. A simple color cut thus virtually eliminates all\nforeground contamination, even at significant redshifts. In this paper, one of\na series of two, we describe the underlying assumptions and basic techniques of\nthe method in detail, and contrast the method with those used by other authors.\nWe provide a brief demonstration of the effectiveness of the technique using\nreal redshift data, and from this conclude that the method offers a powerful\nyet simple way of identify galaxy clusters.

The properties of the variable\npopulations of these objects are consistent with the idea that the Oosterhoff\n\"dichotomy\" is a continuum. The gap between the classes seems to be explained\nby the horizontal branch of Galactic globular clusters shifting away from the\ninstability strip at at intermediate metallicities.

A wide set of deep star counts at\nhigh and intermediate galactic latitudes is used to determine the large scale\ndensity law of the spheroid. Assuming a power density law, the exponent,\nflattening, local density and IMF slope of this population are estimated. The\nestimation is checked for robustness against contamination of star counts by\nthe thick disc population. Contamination effects are derived from a model of\npopulation synthesis under a broad variety of thick disc parameters. The\nparameter fit is based on a maximum likelihood criterion. The best fit spheroid\ndensity law has a flattening of 0.76, a power index of 2.44. There is a\nsignificant degeneracy between these two parameters. The data are also\ncompatible with a slightly less flattened spheroid (c/a = 0.85), in combination\nwith a larger power index (2.75). A flatter spheroid (c/a = 0.6) with a power\nindex of 2 is not excluded either.

These multiple quantum coherences relax at differing\nrates, thus permitting the original state of the data to be approximately\nreconstructed by mixing them together in an appropriate fashion.

In all cases\nwe obtain the optimal measurements for arbitrary fidelities. In particular we\nshow that if the aim is determine as well as possible the direction in which\nthe spins are pointing, it is best to carry out measurements on antiparallel\nspins (as already shown by Gisin and Popescu), second best to carry out\nmeasurements on parallel spins and worst to be restricted to LOCC measurements.\nIf the the aim is to determine as well as possible a direction orthogonal to\nthat in which the spins are pointing, it is best to carry out measurements on\nparallel spins, whereas measurements on antiparallel spins and LOCC\nmeasurements are both less good but equivalent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2000 11:54:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2000 09:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
