Using the\nmulti-waveband data to compare the appearance of galaxies at the same\nrest-frame wavelengths reveals that \"morphological k-corrections\" (the change\nin appearance when viewing high-z objects at shorter rest-frame wavelengths)\nare only important in a minority of cases, and that galaxies were intrinsically\nmore peculiar at high redshift.

We propose that\nmetal enrichment occurs as a two step process. First, supernova (SN) explosions\neject metals into relatively small regions confined to the surroundings of\nstar-forming galaxies. From a comprehensive treatment of blowout we show that\nSNae by themselves fail by more than one order of magnitude to distribute the\nproducts of stellar nucleosynthesis over volumes large enough to pollute the\nwhole IGM to the metallicity levels observed. Thus, a additional (but as yet\nunknown) physical mechanism must be invoked to mix the metals on scales\ncomparable to the mean distance between the galaxies which are most efficient\npollutants. From this simple hypothesis we derive a number of testable\npredictions for the evolution of the IGM metallicity. Specifically, we find\nthat: (i) the fraction of metals ejected over the star formation history of the\nuniverse is about 50% at z=0; that is, approximately half of the metals today\nare found in the IGM; (ii) if the ejected metals were homogeneously mixed with\nthe baryons in the universe, the average IGM metallicity would be <Z> ~ 1/25\nZ(solar) at z=3. However, due to spatial inhomogeneities, the mean of the\ndistribution of metallicities in the diffusive zones has a wide (more than 2\norders of magnitude) spread around this value; (iii) if metals become more\nuniformly distributed at z < 1, as assumed, at z = 0 the metallicity of the IGM\nis narrowly confined within the range Z ~ 0.1 +/- 0.03 Z(solar).

Several approaches\nto investigate the quantum mobility of polarons and bipolarons are proposed for\nthis model. It is found that the bipolaron mass generally remains very large\nexcept in the vicinity of the triple point of the phase diagram, where the\nbipolarons have several degenerate configurations at the adiabatic limit\n(single site (S0), two sites (S1) and quadrisinglet (QS)), while the polarons\nare much lighter.

We show that some model\nvariations, for example a phonon dispersion may increase the stability of the\n(QS) bipolaron against the quantum lattice fluctuations. The triple point of\nthe phase diagram may be stable to quantum lattice fluctuations and a very\nsharp mass reduction may occur, leading to bipolaron masses of the order of 100\nbare electronic mass for realistic parameters.

The fields that are populated then decay quantum\nmechanically if their particles are unstable. Thus, during preheating, a\ndriven-dissipative system exists. We have shown previously that pattern\nformation can occur in two dimensions in a self-coupled inflaton system\nundergoing parametric resonance. In this paper, we provide evidence of pattern\nformation for more realistic initial conditions in both two and three\ndimensions. In the one-field case, we have the novel interpretation that these\npatterns can be thought of as a network of domain walls. We also show that the\npatterns are spatio-temporal, leading to a distinctive, but probably\nlow-amplitude peak in the gravitational wave spectrum. In the context of a\ntwo-field model, we discuss putting power from resonance into patterns on\ncosmological scales, in particular to explain the observed excess power at 100\nh^{-1}Mpc, but why this seems unlikely in the absence of a period of\npost-preheating inflation.

We review the\ncurrent status of such experiments and critically analyze recent claims of a\ndetection of the variability of the fine-structure constant on the cosmological\ntime scale. We stress that such a detection remains to be checked by future\nexperiments and observations. The tightest of the firmly established upper\nlimits read that the considered constants could not vary by more than 0.015% on\nthe scale of 10 Gigayears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2000 06:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
