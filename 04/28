We show that the\ninferred areas of the emitting regions may be over- or under-estimated by a\nfactor of <=2, because of the geometry of the system and general relativistic\nlight deflection, combined with the effects of phase averaging.

This behavior results from the dramatic difference in the exchange\nhole in the two cases, which is partially compensated by a corresponding\nanisotropy in the correlation hole. In addition we observe an anisotropic\nchange in the spin density induced by Coulomb correlation, reducing the spatial\noverlap between the different spin-components of the density and contributing\nto the anisotropy of the correlation hole.
