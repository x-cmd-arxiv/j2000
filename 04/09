A novel direct method for this is summarized and applied to an i(AlPdMn)\ndata set.

The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one\nand is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and potentially\nadmits new generalizations in different directions. In it the Hilbert space of\na quantum system (from conventional quantum mechanics) is replaced with an\nappropriate Hilbert bundle of states and a pure state of the system is\ndescribed by a lifting of paths or section along paths in this bundle. The\nevolution of a pure state is determined through the bundle (analogue of the)\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the density operator\nare described via liftings of paths or morphisms along paths in suitable\nbundles.
