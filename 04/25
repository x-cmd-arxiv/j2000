We derive the covariant nonlinear dynamical equations\nfor the gravitational and matter fields on the brane, and then linearize to\nfind the perturbation equations on the brane. The local energy-momentum\ncorrections are significant only at very high energies. The imprint on the\nbrane of the nonlocal gravitational field in the bulk is more subtle, and we\nprovide a careful decomposition of this effect into nonlocal energy density,\nflux and anisotropic stress. The nonlocal energy density determines the tidal\nacceleration in the off-brane direction, and can oppose singularity formation\nvia the generalized Raychaudhuri equation. Unlike the nonlocal energy density\nand flux, the nonlocal anisotropic stress is not determined by an evolution\nequation on the brane. In particular, isotropy of the cosmic microwave\nbackground may no longer guarantee a Friedmann geometry. Adiabatic density\nperturbations are coupled to perturbations in the nonlocal bulk field, and in\ngeneral the system is not closed on the brane. But on super-Hubble scales,\ndensity perturbations can be evaluated by brane observers. Tensor perturbations\non the brane are suppressed by local bulk effects during inflation, while the\nnonlocal effects can serve as a source or a sink.

These results allow both\nfor precision tests of the Standard Model and new physics, as well as for the\nassessment of the potential physics reach of experiments designed to measure\nspecific observables. Using these expressions, stringent constraints can\nalready be inferred from a recent precision measurement of the statistical\ncapture rate on $^3$He. Likewise, similar constraints should follow the\ncompletion of a precision measurement in progress of the singlet capture rate\non the proton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2000 15:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

And since time\nand space have equal status as dimensions, an object moving through time\nexperiences increasing spatial curvature due to expansion, just as it does when\nmoving through space towards a massive body. So expansion must increase\ngravity, and this increase would be proportional to the amount of red-shift.\nThe kinetic energy of expansion is thus exchanged for curvature of spacetime,\nand this results in spatial gravity. Momentum therefore fuels both spatial and\nmassive gravity. And spatial gravity, which must therefore be proportional to\nthe size of the universe, combines with massive gravity to produce overall\ngravity. A cosmological factor proportional to the size of the universe is\ntherefore appropriate. And the very expansion which causes increasing spatial\ngravity, should cause expansion to be self-limiting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2000 15:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 16:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-24"}

A number of results demonstrate that this system operates with a\nprecision and efficiency near the limits imposed by physics, and more generally\nthese results point to the reliability and efficiency of the strategies that\nnature has selected for representing and processing visual signals. A recent\nseries of papers by Egelhaaf and coworkers, however, suggests that almost all\nthese conclusions are incorrect. In this contribution we place these\ncontroversies in a larger context, emphasizing that the arguments are not just\nabout flies, but rather about how we should quantify the neural response to\ncomplex, naturalistic inputs. As an example, Egelhaaf et al. (and many others)\ncompute certain correlation functions and use the apparent correlation times as\na measure of temporal precision in the neural response. This analysis neglects\nthe structure of the correlation function at short times, and we show how to\nanalyze this structure to reveal a temporal precision 30 times better than\nsuggested by the correlation time; this precision is confirmed by a much more\ndetailed information theoretic analysis. In reviewing other aspects of the\ncontroversy, we find that the analysis methods used by Egelhaaf et al. suffer\nfrom some mathematical inconsistencies, and that in some cases we are unable to\nreproduce their experimental results. Finally, we present results from new\nexperiments that probe the neural response to inputs that approach more closely\nthe natural context for freely flying flies. These new experiments demonstrate\nthat the fly's visual system is even more precise and efficient under natural\nconditions than had been inferred from our earlier work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2000 01:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
