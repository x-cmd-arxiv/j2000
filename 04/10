Therefore they are not well suited for the treatment of deep\nseated tumours. Charged particles, in contrast, exhibit a sharp increase of\nionisation density close to the end of their range, the so-called Bragg-peak.\nThe depth of the Bragg-peak can be adjusted by varying the particle's energy.\nIn parallel with the large energy deposit the increase in biological\neffectiveness for cell killing at the end of the range provides an ideal\nscalpel for the surgeon effectively without touching the surface tissue.\nConsequently proton therapy has gained a lot of ground for treating well\nlocalized tumours. Even superior still are heavy ions, where the ionisation\npattern is increased by the square of their charge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2000 08:45:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
