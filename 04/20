Specifically we derive the joint probability function of\nhalo and mass density contrasts from the extended Press-Schechter theory. Since\nthis function is derived in the framework of the standard gravitational\ninstability theory assuming the random-Gaussianity of the primordial density\nfield alone, we expect that the basic features of the nonlinear and stochastic\nbiasing predicted from our model are fairly generic. As representative\nexamples, we compute the various biasing parameters in cold dark matter models\nas a function of a redshift and a smoothing length. Our major findings are (1)\nthe biasing of the variance evolves strongly as redshift while its\nscale-dependence is generally weak and a simple linear biasing model provides a\nreasonable approximation roughly at $R\\simgt 2(1+z)\\himpc$, and (2) the\nstochasticity exhibits moderate scale-dependence especially on $R\\simlt\n20\\himpc$, but is almost independent of $z$.

Nearby the NS interface, all the spectra show a dip\nnear the Fermi energy but depending on the geometry, different behaviours can\nbe distinguished. First, when the characteristic size of the normal metal $L$\nis much larger than the coherence length $\\xi_N \\simeq \\sqrt{\\hbar D_N/\n2\\Delta}$, the spectral extension of the dip decreases from $\\Delta$ at the NS\ninterface to zero at distances $x\\gg\\xi_N$. Second, when $L$ is comparable to\n$\\xi_N$ the apparent gap in the LDOS is space-independent and related to the\nThouless energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2000 19:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Recently,\nan approach closely related to the ADM one, commonly referred to as as\n``conformal ADM'' (CADM) has shown excellent results when modeling waves on\nflat spacetimes and black hole spacetimes where singularity avoiding slices are\nused to deal with the singularity. In these cases, the use of CADM has yielded\nlonger evolutions and better outer boundary dependence than those obtained with\nthe ADM one. If this success translates to the case where excision is\nimplemented, then the CADM formulation will likely be a prime candidate for\nmodeling generic black hole spacetimes.
