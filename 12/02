In this paper\nI demonstrate that with the careful use of a `physical morphology' it is\npossible to determine quantitatively how the process of galaxy evolution is\noccurring out to z=4. Using a system of parameters that traces star formation\nand galaxy interactions, I show how distinct galaxy populations at high-z can\nbe identified in deep high-resolution optical and NIR images. These tools are\nalso used to measure a potential merger fraction of galaxies from 0<z<4. If\nthese methods are reliable, as is suggested by a local galaxy calibration, the\nmerger fraction of galaxies scales as (1+z)^{2.1+/-0.5}, peaks near z=2, and\ndeclines thereafter.

First we\nshow that under astrophysical conditions, a cold electron-positron plasma is\nunstable with respect to a two-stream instability in the interface between\nthese regions. The instability heats the inflowing cold plasma rapidly, on a\ntimescale comparable to the inverse of its plasma frequency. We then derive\ntime-independent equations to describe the resulting hot state of the pair\nplasma, and describe the conditions under which the spatially uniform solution\nis the unique stable solution for the post shock conditions. We also examine\nplasmas composed of cold protons and hot electrons, and show that the spatially\nuniform solution is the unique stable solution there as well. We state the\nshock jump conditions which connect a cold, electron-proton plasma to a hot\nelectron-proton plasma.

GRAPE is a special-purpose hardware for the calculation of\ngravitational force between particles. Although the treecode has been\nimplemented on GRAPE, we could handle terms only up to dipole, since GRAPE can\ncalculate forces from point-mass particles only.

In this paper we examine the implications of burnout\non the late time prepayment rate using rather general assumptions. Analytic\nformulas are derived for the average prepayment rate in the N'th month, P_N,\nand the fraction of borrowers left in the pool in the N'th month, y_N. In the\ncase where the incentive to refinance, and other relevent economic factors, are\nconstant these results are particularly simple. For example, P_N=p+(1-p)/N+...\n, where p is a constant and the ellipses denote terms suppressed by more powers\nof 1/N or exponentially suppressed.
