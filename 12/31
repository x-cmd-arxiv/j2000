In\ngeneral, the properties of the Lyman-alpha forest at 1.5 < z < 2.4, such as the\ndifferent density distribution function, the correlation strengths and the mean\nneutral hydrogen opacity, evolve as expected extrapolating from at z > 2.4.\nThese results suggest the main drive of the redshift evolution of the forest at\n1.5 < z < 4 is the Hubble expansion.

The stochastic regime resting\nbetween the quantum and semi-classical captures the statistical mechanical\nattributes of the full theory. Applying the particle-centric world-line\nquantization formulation to the quantum field theory of scalar QED we derive a\ntime-dependent (scalar) Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation and show that it\nis the correct semiclassical limit for nonlinear particle-field systems without\nthe need of making the dipole or non-relativistic approximations. Progressing\nto the stochastic regime, we derive multiparticle ALD-Langevin equations for\nnonlinearly coupled particle-field systems. With these equations we show how to\naddress time-dependent dissipation/noise/renormalization in the semiclassical\nand stochastic limits of QED. We clarify the the relation of radiation\nreaction, quantum dissipation and vacuum fluctuations and the role that initial\nconditions may play in producing non-Lorentz invariant noise. We emphasize the\nfundamental role of decoherence in reaching the semiclassical limit, which also\nsuggests the correct way to think about the issues of runaway solutions and\npreacceleration from the presence of third derivative terms in the ALD\nequation. We show that the semiclassical self-consistent solutions obtained in\nthis way are ``paradox'' and pathology free both technically and conceptually.\nThis self-consistent treatment serves as a new platform for investigations into\nproblems related to relativistic moving charges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2000 22:36:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2001 17:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
