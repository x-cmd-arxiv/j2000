We have worked out tests of the\nR-parity violating interactions. First, we have studied clear signals of the\nsingle production of supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles,\nwhich involves the R-parity violating interactions, in the context of physics\nat next leptonic and hadronic colliders. The results show that strong\nsensitivities could be obtained on the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters\nand indicate the possibility of an improvement of one to two order of magnitude\nconcerning the present indirect limits on the values of several R-parity\nviolating coupling constants. Besides, it has been verified that the single\nsuperpartner production analysis offers the opportunity to reconstruct in a\nmodel independent way some superpartner masses with an high accuracy. Secondly,\nwe have studied CP symmetry violation effects, due to the complex phases of\nR-parity violating coupling constants, in the pair production of either\nfermions or sfermions of different flavors at future leptonic colliders. We\nhave seen notably that the single top quark production allows to test the CP\nviolation in the hadronic sector.

Large double (DL) and single (SL) logarithmic\nvirtual electroweak Sudakov corrections lead to significant effects for\nobservable cross sections. Recently, leading and subleading universal\ncorrections for external fermions and transverse gauge boson lines were\nresummed by employing the infrared evolution equation method. The results were\nconfirmed at the DL level by explicit two loop calculations with the physical\nStandard Model (SM) fields. Also for longitudinal degrees of freedom the\napproach was utilized for DL-corrections via the Goldstone boson equivalence\ntheorem. In all cases, the electroweak Sudakov logarithms exponentiate. In this\npaper we extend the same approach to both Yukawa enhanced as well as subleading\nSudakov corrections to longitudinal gauge boson and Higgs production. We use\nvirtual contributions to splitting functions of the appropriate Goldstone\nbosons in the high energy regime and find that all universal subleading terms\nexponentiate.

As a side result, we obtain also all top-Yukawa enhanced\nsubleading logarithms for chiral fermion production at high energies to all\norders.

It is demonstrated that a field of\nsufficiently high chirp rate imposes a certain relative phase between a ground\nand excited state wavefunction of a two-level system. The value of the relative\nphase angle is thus restricted to be negative and close to 0 or $-\\pi$ for\npositive and negative chirp, respectively. This explains the unidirectionality\nof the population transfer from the ground to the excited state. In a molecular\nsystem composed of a ground and excited potential energy surface the symmetry\nbetween the action of a pulse with a large positive and negative chirp is\nbroken. The same framwork of the coherent mechanism can explain the symmetry\nbreaking and the population inversion due to a positive chirped field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2000 18:20:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2001 12:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
