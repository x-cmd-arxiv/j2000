The inhomogeneities\nconsist of periodic shock fronts bounding narrow, high-density regions,\ninterspersed with much broader regions of low density. The radiation flux\navoids the regions of high density, which are therefore weighed down by\ngravity, while gas in the low-density regions is slammed upward into the shock\nfronts by radiation force. As the wave pattern moves through the atmosphere,\neach parcel of matter alternately experiences upward and downward forces, which\nbalance on average. Magnetic tension shares the competing forces between\nregions of different densities, preventing the atmosphere from blowing apart.\nWe calculate the density structure and phase speed of the wave pattern, and\nrelate these to the wavelength, the density contrast, and the factor by which\nthe net radiation flux exceeds the Eddington limit. In principle, this factor\ncan be as large as the ratio of magnetic pressure to mean gas pressure, or the\nratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure, whichever is smaller. Although the\nmagnetic pressure must be large compared to the mean gas pressure in order to\nsupport a large density contrast, it need not be large compared to the\nradiation pressure.

All physical\nquantities can be expressed as a function of double-occupancy (in addition to\ntemperature and filling). Double-occupancy is determined without adjustable\nparameter by imposing the Pauli principle and a crucial sum-rule, making the\nfirst step of the approximation Two-Particle Self-Consistent.

When the function F(z,z',z'',s)\nsatisfies a special differential condition of the form, U[F]=0, the conformal\nmetric possesses a conformal Killing field, xi = partial with respect to s,\nwhich in turn, allows the conformal metric to be mapped into a three\ndimensional Lorentzian metric on the space (z,z',z'') or equivalently, on the\nspace of solutions of the original differential equation. This construction is\nthen generalized to the pair of differential equations, z_ss =\nS(z,z_s,z_t,z_st,s,t) and z_tt = T(z,z_s,z_t,z_st,s,t), with z_s and z_t, the\nderivatives of z with respect to s and t. In this case, from S and T, one can\nagain, in a natural manner, construct a Lorentzian conformal metric on the six\ndimensional space (z,z_s,z_t,z_st,s,t). When the S and T satisfy equations\nanalogous to U[F]=0, namely equations of the form M[S,T]=0, the 6-space then\npossesses a pair of conformal Killing fields, xi =partial with respect to s and\neta =partial with respect to t which allows, via the mapping to the four-space\nof z, z_s, z_t, z_st and a choice of conformal factor, the construction of a\nfour-dimensional Lorentzian metric. In fact all four-dimensional Lorentzian\nmetrics can be constructed in this manner. This construction, with further\nconditions on S and T, thus includes all (local) solutions of the Einstein\nequations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2000 20:12:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 May 2001 18:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The major\ncontribution to noncommutative geometry was made by A. Connes, who, in\nparticular, analyzed Yang-Mills theories on noncommutative spaces, using\nimportant notions that were introduced in his papers (connection, Chern\ncharacter, etc). It was found recently that Yang-Mills theories on\nnoncommutative spaces appear naturally in string/M-theory; the notions and\nresults of noncommutative geometry were applied very successfully to the\nproblems of physics.\n  In this paper we give a mostly self-contained review of some aspects of\nM(atrix) theory, of Connes' noncommutative geometry and of applications of\nnoncommutative geometry to M(atrix) theory. The topics include introduction to\nBFSS and IKKT matrix models, compactifications on noncommutative tori, a review\nof basic notions of noncommutative geometry with a detailed discussion of\nnoncommutative tori, Morita equivalence and $SO(d,d|{\\mathbb Z})$-duality, an\nelementary discussion of instantons and noncommutative orbifolds. The review is\nprimarily intended for physicists who would like to learn some basic techniques\nof noncommutative geometry and how they can be applied in string theory and to\nmathematicians who would like to learn about some new problems arising in\ntheoretical physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2000 01:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2001 23:30:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Jul 2001 07:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
