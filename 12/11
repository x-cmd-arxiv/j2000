Evidence for variability with RMS amplitudes (in the I band) of 0.01\nto 0.055 magnitudes on timescales of 0.4 to 100 hours is discovered in half of\nthese objects. Power spectral analysis using the CLEAN algorithm was performed\nto search for evidence of periodic variability. Some objects show strong\nperiodicities at around a few hours, which could be due to rotational\nmodulation of the light curve by surface features. However, several objects do\nnot have any significant periodicities to explain their variability. The vsini\nvalues of a similar population of objects makes it very likely that our time\nsampling was sensitive to the expected range of rotation periods, and\nsimulations show that we would have detected these if they were caused by\nlong-lived surface features. We argue that this absence of periodicity is due\nto the evolution of the brightness, and presumably also the physical size, of\nsurface features on timescales of a few to a few tens of hours. This is\nsupported in the case of 2M1145 for which two light curves have been obtained\none year apart and show no common periodicity.
