The angular dependence, in tilted magnetic fields of\nF_l and F_h, reveals the 2D character of the FS and Angular dependent\nmagnetoresistance (AMRO) further suggests a FS which is strictly 2-D where the\ninter-plane hopping t_c is virtually absent or incoherent. The Hall constant\nR_xy is field independent, and the Hall mobility increases by a factor of 3\nunder moderate magnetic fields. Our observations suggest a unique physical\nsituation where a stable 2D Fermi liquid state in the molecular layers are\nincoherently coupled along the least conducting direction. The magnetic field\nnot only reduces the inelastic scattering between the 2D metallic layers, but\nit also reveals the incoherent nature of interplane transport in the AMRO\nspectrum. The apparent ferromagnetism of the hysteretic magnetoresistance\nremains an unsolved problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2000 23:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The gas-filled linear radiofrequency ion trap system is\ninstalled at the Penning trap mass spectrometer ISOLTRAP at ISOLDE/CERN. Its\npurpose is to accumulate the 60-keV continuous ISOLDE ion beam with high\nefficiency and to convert it into low-energy low-emittance ion pulses. The\nefficiency was found to exceed 10% in agreement with simulations. A more than\n10-fold reduction of the ISOLDE beam emittance can be achieved. The system has\nbeen used successfully for first on-line experiments. Its principle, setup and\nperformance will be discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2000 17:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}
