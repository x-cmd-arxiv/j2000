We\ndemonstrate that compressing a galaxy's light distribution along the line of\nsight produces approximately the same signature in the line-of-sight velocity\nprofiles as radial anisotropy. In particular, fitting spherically symmetric\ndynamical models to apparently round, isotropic face-on flattened galaxies\nleads to a spurious bias towards radial orbits in the models, especially if the\ngalaxy has a weak face-on stellar disk. Such face-on stellar disks could\nplausibly be the cause of the radial anisotropy found in spherical models of\nintermediate luminosity ellipticals such as NGC 2434, NGC 3379 and NGC 6703.\n  In the light of this result, we use simple dynamical models to constrain the\nouter mass profiles of a sample of 18 round, early-type galaxies. The galaxies\nfollow a Tully-Fisher relation parallel to that for spiral galaxies, but\nfainter by at least 0.8 mag (I-band) for a given mass. The most luminous\ngalaxies show clear evidence for the presence of a massive dark halo, but the\ncase for dark haloes in fainter galaxies is more ambiguous. We discuss the\nobservations that would be required to resolve this ambiguity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2000 12:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Because of their enormous brightness and apparent\nhomogeneity SN Ia have become an important tool to measure cosmological\nparameters.\n  In this article the present understanding of the physics of thermonuclear\nexplosions is reviewed. In particular, we focus our attention on subsonic\n(\"deflagration\") fronts, i.e. we investigate fronts propagating by heat\ndiffusion and convection rather than by compression. Models based upon this\nmode of nuclear burning have been applied very successfully to the SN Ia\nproblem, and are able to reproduce many of their observed features remarkably\nwell. However, the models also indicate that SN Ia may differ considerably from\neach other, which is of importance if they are to be used as standard candles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2000 12:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
