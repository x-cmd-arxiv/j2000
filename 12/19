These values agree well with the estimates using the\nlocally measured cosmic-ray energy spectrum and the radial variation of protons\nderived from gamma-rays. Optical and synchrotron polarization data yield a\nstrength of the local regular field of 4 +/- 1 muG, but this value is an upper\nlimit if the field strength fluctuates within the beam or if anisotropic fields\nare present. Pulsar rotation measures, on the other hand, give only 1.4 +/- 0.2\nmuG, a lower limit if fluctuations in regular field strength and thermal\nelectron density are anticorrelated along the pathlength. The local regular\nfield may be part of a 'magnetic arm' between the optical arms. However, the\nglobal structure of the regular Galactic field is not yet known. Several\nlarge-scale field reversals in the Galaxy were detected from rotation measure\ndata, but a similar phenomenon was not observed in external galaxies. The\nGalactic field may be young in terms of dynamo action so that reversals from\nthe chaotic seed field are preserved, or a mixture of dynamo modes causes the\nreversals, or the reversals are signatures of large-scale anisotropic field\nloops. The Galaxy is surrounded by a thick disk of radio continuum emission of\nsimilar extent as in edge-on spiral galaxies. While the local field in the thin\ndisk is of even symmetry with respect to the plane (quadrupole), the global\nthick-disk field may be of dipole type. The Galactic center region hosts highly\nregular fields of up to milligauss strength which are oriented perpendicular to\nthe plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2000 11:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Although elements of QS act in one dimension, most results depend on a\ntwo-dimensional proof. QS has a manifold structure modelled on a Banach space,\nand after factorization by PSL(2,R} it becomes a complex manifold. This\nquotient space contains deformation spaces of many types of dynamical system\nand for every hyperbolic Riemann surface, and in this naive sense it is\nuniversal. Here however, we focus on the analytic foundations of the theory\nnecessary for applications to dynamical systems and rigidity. We divide the\npaper into two parts. The first part concerns the real theory of QS and results\nthat can be stated purely in real terms; the basic properties are given mostly\nwithout proof, except in certain cases when an easy real-variable proof is\navailable. The second part of the paper brings in the complex analysis and\npromotes the view that properties of quasisymmetric maps are most easily\nunderstood by consideration of their possible two-dimensional quasiconformal\nextensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2000 19:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The relativistic bound state problem for three quarks is considered.\nDiquarks are introduced as separable correlations in the two-quark correlation\nfunction and thereby baryons are described by a Bethe-Salpeter equation for\nbound states of quark and diquark which interact by quark exchange. In analogy\nto the meson spectrum, scalar and axialvector diquarks are considered to be the\nmost important two-quark configurations within baryons. The numerical solutions\nof the covariant Bethe-Salpeter equation are subsequently employed in the\ncalculation of electromagnetic, strong and axial form factors of the nucleons.\nThe construction of the electromagnetic current operator in the diquark-quark\nmodel respects gauge invariance. Invariance under chiral symmetry\ntransformations is slightly violated for vector diquarks have been neglected,\nleading to a modest violation of the Goldberger-Treiman relation.

For pure states we introduce the Slater\ndecomposition and rank (in analogy to Schmidt decomposition and rank), i.e. we\ndecompose the state into a combination of elementary Slater determinants formed\nby mutually orthogonal single-particle states. Mixed states can be\ncharacterized by their Slater number which is the minimal Slater rank required\nto generate them. For K=2 we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a\nstate to have a Slater number of 1. We introduce a correlation measure for\nmixed states which can be evaluated analytically for K=2. For higher K, we\nprovide a method of constructing and optimizing Slater number witnesses, i.e.\noperators that detect Slater number for some states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2000 16:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2001 11:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

We obtain the\nconditional evolution through a wave-particle correlation function that\nmeasures the time evolution of the field after the detection of a photon. A\nconnection exists between this correlation function and the spectrum of\nsqueezing which permits the study of squeezed states in the time domain. We\ncalculate the spectrum of squeezing from the master equation for the reduced\ndensity matrix using both the quantum regression theorem and quantum\ntrajectories.

As a result of this\ninteraction, quantum dynamics of the vibrational degree of freedom becomes\ncomplicated, and in some ranges of parameters even chaotic. We analyze the\nvibrational ion dynamics using a formal analogy with the solid-state problem of\nelectron localization. In particular, we show how the resonant approximation\nused in analysis of the ion dynamics, leads to a transition from a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) to a one-dimensional problem (1D) of electron\nlocalization. The localization length in the solid-state problem is estimated\nin cases of weak and strong interaction between the cites of the 2D cell by\nusing the methods of resonance perturbation theory, common in analysis of 1D\ntime-dependent dynamical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2000 23:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
