We write the Yang-Mills action for the affine\nconnection and vary it both with respect to the metric and the connection. We\nfind a family of spacetimes which are stationary points. These spacetimes are\nwaves of torsion in Minkowski space. We then find a special subfamily of\nspacetimes with zero Ricci curvature; the latter condition is the Einstein\nequation describing the absence of sources of gravitation. A detailed\nexamination of this special subfamily suggests the possibility of using it to\nmodel the neutrino.
