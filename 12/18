(ii) Most ellipticals are moderately\nradially anisotropic; their dynamical structure is surprisingly uniform. (iii)\nElliptical galaxies follow a Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, with v_c^max=300 km/s\nfor an L_B^* galaxy.

Similarly, incentives for tax-reducing strategies put much\nsand in the wheels of the economy. Demands to replace our monumental tax code\nwith a simple, graceful one that does not distort economic incentives heat up\nperiodically in political debate, but such dreams never materialize. A\nFUNDAMENTAL obstacle, not yet well understood in the economic literature, is\nthe impossibility of objectively evaluating the tax base -- assets, income,\netc. One can see this even in toy examples, say, trying to assess the value of\na position in chess: great masters' assessments will all differ. Here computer\ntheory can add an insight not provided by classical economics tools.\n  A way around is to avoid evaluations by expressing the tax in natural units,\nnot in cash.

(Tax tools MEANT to influence corporate\npolicies should be set as explicit separate taxes or credits, open to public\nscrutiny, not hidden between lines of an incomprehensible tax code.) Roughly,\nthe~system is to periodically take a t*i fraction of shares to auction, where t\nis the tax rate, i is the interest rate. It replaces all income taxes on\npublicly traded corporations, their subsidiaries, and shareholders.\n  The interest rate is defined via specially designed bonds, so that the whole\nsystem can be shown PRECISELY equivalent to a flat tax on INVESTMENT RETURN.\nNote that taxing the return DIRECTLY is impossible: it would invite\nmanipulation of stock market~prices.

In terms of the variance of the number of eigenvalues in an\ninterval containing $n$ eigenvalues on average, it results in a crossover from\na $\\log n$-behavior to a $n^2 \\log n$-behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2000 00:12:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2001 22:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The probability can approach\n100%, yet the measurement can undergo complete quantum erasure. In the EPR\nsetting, we prove that i) every partial measurement nonlocally creates the same\npartial change in the distant particle; and ii) every erasure inflicts the same\nerasure on the distant particle's state. This enables an EPR experiment where\nthe nonlocal effect does not vanish after a single measurement but keeps\n\"traveling\" back and forth between particles. We study an experiment in which\ntwo distant particles are subjected to interferometry with a partial \"which\npath\" measurement. Such a measurement causes a variable amount of correlation\nbetween the particles. A new inequality is formulated for same-angle\npolarizations, extending Bell's inequality for different angles. The resulting\nnonlocality proof is highly visualizable, as it rests entirely on the\ninterference effect. Partial measurement also gives rise to a new form of\nentanglement, where the particles manifest correlations of multiple\npolarization directions. Another novelty in that the measurement to be erased\nis fully observable, in contrast to prevailing erasure techniques where it can\nnever be observed. Some profound conceptual implications of our experiment are\nbriefly pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2000 06:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
