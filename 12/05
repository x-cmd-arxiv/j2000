Theoretical considerations suggest that a cold dark matter universe has\nbeen a very hostile place for the formation of small galaxies. In particular,\ngas would not have been able to cool and condense to form stars inside dark\nmatter halos with a velocity dispersion <10km/s since before the cosmological\nreionization epoch. In other words, one should not expect to see any major star\nformation activities in dwarf galaxies with a velocity dispersion <10km/s\nduring the past 12Gyr, according to the current structure formation theory. The\nreal universe, on the other hand, shows that all dwarf spheroidal galaxies in\nthe Local Group have velocity dispersions <10km/s and extended and recent star\nformation activities are quite common in them. This apparent conflict between\ncold dark matter models and local observations can be resolved, if one allows\nthe cold dark matter particles to decay relatively recently. The resolution\ncomes about in that the dwarf spheroidal galaxies with a velocity dispersion of\n\\~10km/s seen today were born, in this picture, in a small fraction of halos\nwith a velocity dispersion of ~20km/s, where gas can be retained and is able to\ncool and contract to form stars. The presently observed lower velocity\ndispersion ~10km/s of these dwarf spheroidal galaxies is a consequence of the\ndecay of one half of the dark matter in and subsequent expansion of the halos\nsince redshift z~2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2000 16:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

We use a lambda-iteration radiative transfer code to model the data.\nWe adopt a similar form of radial density profile to that which we have found\nin all pre-stellar cores, with a `flat' inner profile, steepening towards the\nedge, but we make the gradient of the `flat' region a free parameter. We find\nthat the core is close to virial equilibrium, but there is tentative evidence\nfor core contraction. We allow the temperature to vary with a power-law form\nand find we can consistently fit all of the CO data with an inverse temperature\ngradient that is warmer at the edge than the centre. However, when we combine\nthe CO data with the previously published millimetre data we fail to find a\nsimultaneous fit to both data-sets without additionally allowing the CO\nabundance to decrease towards the centre. This effect has been observed\nqualitatively many times before, as the CO freezes out onto the dust grains at\nhigh densities, but we quantify the effect. Hence we show that the combination\nof mm/submm continuum and spectral line data is a very powerful method of\nconstraining the physical parameters of cores on the verge of forming stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2000 10:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We confirm that the 1-2.2 micron nuclear continuum of some Sy 2s is\ndominated by stellar emission, whereas the continuum emission at longer\nwavelengths (3-5 micron) is almost entirely non-stellar in origin. The IR\nnon-stellar spectral energy distributions (SED) (up to 15 micron) of Sy\ngalaxies show a variety of shapes, and they are well reproduced with the\ntapered disk models of Efstathiou & Rowan-Robinson (1995). We have used two\nmodels, one including an optically thin cone component and a coneless model.\nAlthough our modelling of the SEDs does not allow us to favor either model to\naccount for all the observed SEDs, we find that the viewing angle towards the\ncentral source is well constrained by both models. We have also investigated\nnon-stellar color-color diagrams. The colors of the Sy galaxies with viewing\nangles theta < 30 degree are better reproduced with the cone model. These\ndiagrams provide a good means to separate Sy 2s with moderate obscuration (A_V\n< 20 mag, from hard X-ray observations) from those with high obscuration. The\nground-based 4.8 micron and ISO 9.6 micron luminosities are well correlated\nwith the hard X-ray luminosities of Sy 1s and 2s. These continuum emissions\nappear as a good indicator of the AGN luminosity, at least in the cases of hard\nX-ray Compton-thin Sy galaxies. We finally stress the finding that some Compton\nthick galaxies show bright non-stellar emission at 5 micron. This suggests that\nthe near-IR emission in Sys is produced in an extended component illuminated by\nthe central source, that is more visible from all viewing angles. We discuss\npossible implications of mid-IR surveys for the search of counterparts of\nhighly obscured hard X-ray sources.

In the former case, depending on a star's position and orbit\nin the cluster over 10^7 years, UV photoevaporation removes at least 0.01 Msol\nfrom its disk, and can remove up to 1 Msol. We find no dynamical models of the\nONC consistent with the suggestion of Storzer and Hollenbach that the observed\ndistribution and abundance of proplyds could be explained by a population of\nstars on radial orbits which spend relatively little time near Theta 1C Ori\n(the most massive star in the ONC). Instead the observations require either\nmassive disks (e.g. a typical initial disk mass of 0.4 Msol) or a very recent\nbirth for Theta 1C Ori. When we consider the photoevaporation of the inner 10\nAU of disks in the ONC, we find that planet formation would be hardly affected.\nOutside that region, planets would be prevented from forming in about half the\nsystems, unless either the initial disk masses were very high or they formed in\nless than ~ 2 Myr and Theta 1C Ori has only very recently appeared. We also\npresent statistics on the distribution of minimum stellar encounter\nseparations.

The model is a simple, discrete, stochastic fracture\nmodel where the elements (asperities or barriers) break because of static\nfatigue, transfer stress according to a local load-sharing rule and then are\nregenerated. We find a very good agreement between the model and the Eastern\nPyrenees aftershock sequence and we propose that the key mechanism for\nexplaining aftershocks, apart from a time-dependent rock strength, is the\npresence of dynamic stress fluctuations which constantly reset the initial\nconditions for the next aftershock in the sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2000 14:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

From the $D_s$ decay, we obtain masses and widths of\n$f_0(980)$ and $f_0(1370)$. We find evidence for a light and broad scalar\nresonance, the $\\sigma$ meson, in $D^+\\to\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ decay. Preliminary\nstudies also show evidence for a light and broad resonance, the $\\kappa$ meson,\nin $D^+\\to K^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ decay. These results illustrate the potential of\ncharm decays as a laboratory for the study of light mesons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2000 00:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Because of that, percolation theory seems to be an ideal framework to\ndevise a geometrical picture of a second order phase transition; the leading\ncharacters of the phenomenon are ordered domains, whose size increases while\napproaching the threshold until they fuse into a spanning structure, so that\nthe order from local becomes global. Such a geometrical picture is known to be\nsuccessful in the Ising model. The clusters are site-bond clusters, i.e. they\nare built by joining nearest-neighbouring aligned spins with some\ntemperature-dependent bond probability.

Ideal experiments involve either\ninequalities (Bell) or equalities (Greenberger, Horne, Zeilinger). Every real\nexperiment has its own critical inequalities, which are almost all more\ncomplicated than the corresponding ideal inequalities and equalities. If one of\nthese critical inequalities is violated, then the detection loophole is closed,\nwith no further assumptions. If all the critical inequalities are satisfied,\nthen it remains open, unless further assumptions are made. The computer program\ndescribed here and published on the website\nhttp://www.strings.ph.qmw.ac.uk/QI/main.htm obtains the critical inequalities\nfor any real experiment, given the number of allowed settings of the angles and\nthe corresponding possible output signals for a single run. Given all the\nnecessary conditional probabilities or rates, it tests whether all these\ninequalities are satisfied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2000 15:34:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2000 14:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
