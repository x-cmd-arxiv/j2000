We provide explicit strong locally\nuniform asymptotics for a sequence of exact solutions corresponding to initial\ndata that has been modified in an asymptotically small sense. We call this\nsequence of exact solutions a semiclassical soliton ensemble. Our asymptotics\nare valid in regions of the (x,t) plane where a certain scalar complex phase\nfunction can be found. We characterize this complex phase function directly by\na finite-gap ansatz and also via the critical point theory of a certain\nfunctional; the latter provides the correct generalization of the variational\nprinciple exploited by Lax and Levermore in their study of the zero-dispersion\nlimit of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2000 19:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We study the Helmholtz free energy, combining\nMatsubara's formalism, in which the temperature appears as a periodic Euclidean\nfourth dimension of circumference 1/T, with the semiclassical periodic orbital\napproximation of Gutzwiller. By inspecting the known results for the Casimir\nenergy at T=0 for a rectangular parallelepiped, one is led to guess at the\nexpression for the free energy of two ideal parallel conductors without\nperforming any calculation. The result is a new form for the free energy in\nterms of the lengths of periodic classical paths on a two-dimensional cylinder\nsection. This expression for the free energy is equivalent to others that have\nbeen obtained in the literature. Slightly extending the domain of applicability\nof Gutzwiller's semiclassical periodic orbit approach, we evaluate the free\nenergy at T>0 in terms of periodic classical paths in a four-dimensional cavity\nthat is the tensor product of the original cavity and a circle. The validity of\nthis approach is at present restricted to particular systems. We also discuss\nthe origin of the classical form of the free energy at high temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2000 01:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
