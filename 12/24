COMPASS uses 100-280 GeV beams (muon, pion) and a\nvirtual photon target, and magnetic spectrometers and calorimeters to measure\nthe complete kinematics of pion-photon reactions. The COMPASS experiment is\nscheduled to begin data runs in 2001. Pion polarizabilities and hybrid mesons\ncan be studied via the Primakoff reactions pion + gamma ---> pion + gamma and\npion + gamma ---> Hybrid. The electric (alpha) and magnetic (beta) pion and\nKaon polarizabilities characterize their deformation in an electromagnetic\nfield, as occurs during gamma-pion Compton scattering. They depend on the\nrigidity of their internal structures as composite particles, and are therefore\nimportant quantities to test the validity of theoretical models. The\npolarizability measurement will provide an important new test of QCD chiral\ndynamics. The studies of quark-antiquark-gluon hybrid mesons would improve our\nunderstanding of these exotic mesons.
