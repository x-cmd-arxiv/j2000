Dynamical modeling of these velocity dispersions\nsuggests that NGC 2681 does host a supermassive black hole (BH) for which one\ncan estimate a firm mass upper limit M_BH < 6*10^7 Solar Masses. This upper\nlimit is consistent with the relation between the central BH mass and velocity\ndispersion M_BH - sigma known for other galaxies. The emission line ratios\nplace the nucleus of NGC 2681 among LINERs. It is likely that the emission line\nregion comes from a rather mild, but steady, feeding of gas to the central BH\nin this galaxy. The inner stellar population lacks any measurable color\ngradient (to a radius of 0.6 kpc) from the infrared to the ultraviolet,\nconsistently with FOC, FOS and IUE data, all indicating that this system\nunderwent a starburst ~1 Gyr ago that encompassed its whole interior, down to\nits very center. The most likely source of such a widely-distributed starburst\nis the dumping of tidally-extruded gas from a galaxy neighbor. If so, then NGC\n2681 can be considered as the older brother of M82, seen face-on as opposed to\nthe edge-on view we have for M82.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2000 09:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

These amplitudes are evaluated in their\nmost general form (to include in our discussion automatically the question of\nambiguities) on the point of view of a strategy to manipulate and calculate\ndivergent amplitudes that can avoid the explicit calculation of divergent\nintegrals. Rather than this only general properties are used in intermediary\nsteps. With this treatment, the results obtained by others authors can be\neasily recovered and we show that, if we choose to impose U(1) gauge invariance\nmaintenance in the pure QED calculated amplitudes, to be consistent with the\nrenormalizability, the induced Chern-Simons term assumes a nonvanishing\nambiguities free value. However if, in addition, we choose to get an answer\nconsistent with renormalizability by anomaly cancellation of the Standard Model\na vanishing value can be obtained, in accordance with what was previously\nconjectured by other authors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2000 02:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

For example the Toda models are well-known\ntheories which possess such a non-linear W-symmetry and many features of these\nmodels can only be understood if one investigates the reduction procedure. In\nthis paper we analyze the SL(n,R) case from which the so-called W_n-algebras\ncan be obtained. One advantage of the reduction viewpoint is that it gives a\nconstructive way to classify the symplectic leaves of the W-algebra which we\nhad done in the n=2 case which will correspond to the coadjoint orbits of the\nVirasoro algebra and for n=3 which case gives rise to the Zamolodchikov\nalgebra. Our method in principle is capable of constructing explicit\nrepresentatives on each leaf. Another attractive feature of this approach is\nthe fact that the global nature of the W-transformations can be explicitly\ndescribed. The reduction method also enables one to determine the ``classical\nhighest weight (h. w.) states'' which are the stable minima of the energy on a\nW-leaf. These are important as only to those leaves can a highest weight\nrepresentation space of the W-algebra be associated which contains a\n``classical h. w. state''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2000 14:44:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2001 14:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2001 12:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

For, the presence of\nlong-range Coulomb forces has been thought to give rise to such severe\nsingularities in their kernels that the latter may lack the compactness\nproperty known to exist in the case of purely short-range interactions.\nEmploying the rigorously equivalent formulation in terms of an\neffective-two-body theory we have proved in a preceding paper [Phys.

In the present paper we\nprove that, for particles with charges of equal sign, the diagonal kernels, in\ncontrast, possess one, but only one, nonintegrable singularity. The latter can,\nhowever, be isolated explicitly and dealt with in a well-defined manner. Taken\ntogether these results imply that modified integral equations can be\nformulated, with kernels that become compact after a few iterations.

The first main result is\nthat the Hilbert space obtained by using the Kahler polarization is naturally\nidentifiable with the generalized Segal-Bargmann space introduced by the author\nfrom a different point of view, namely that of heat kernels. The second main\nresult is that the pairing map of geometric quantization coincides with the\ngeneralized Segal-Bargmann transform introduced by the author. This means that\nin this case the pairing map is a constant multiple of a unitary map. For both\nresults it is essential that the half-form correction be included when using\nthe Kahler polarization.
