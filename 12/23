The key questions we are\naddressing in this paper are: (1) What happens when the instability becomes\nnonlinear? Specifically, does it lead to vortex formation? (2) What is the\ndetailed behavior of a vortex? (3) Can the instability sustain itself and can\nthe vortex last a long time? Among various initial equilibria that we have\nexamined, we generally find that there are three stages of the disk evolution:\n(1) The exponential growth of the initial small amplitude perturbations. This\nis in excellent agreement with the linear theory; (2) The production of large\nscale vortices and their interactions with the background flow, including\nshocks. Significant accretion is observed due to these vortices. (3) The\ncoupling of Rossby waves/vortices with global spiral waves, which facilitates\nfurther accretion throughout the whole disk. Even after more than 20\nrevolutions at the radius of vortices, we find that the disk maintains a state\nthat is populated with vortices, shocks, spiral waves/shocks, all of which\ntransport angular momentum outwards. We elucidate the physics at each stage and\nshow that there is an efficient outward angular momentum transport in stages\n(2) and (3) over most parts of the disk, with an $\\alpha$ in the range from\n$10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$. We show why such vortices prove to be almost ideal\n``units'' in transporting angular momentum outwards, namely by positively\ncorrelating the radial and azimuthal velocity components. We find some special\ncases in which entropy can remain the same while angular momentum is\ntransported. We conclude that Rossby wave/vortex instability is an efficient,\npurely hydrodynamic mechanism for angular momentum transport in thin disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2000 17:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
