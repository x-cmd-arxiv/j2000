We emphasize recent\ntheoretical achievements, for instance, band structure effects in neutrino\nemission due to scattering of electrons in Coulomb crystals of atomic nuclei.\nWe consider the standard composition of matter (neutrons, protons, electrons,\nmuons, hyperons) in the core, and also the case of exotic constituents such as\nthe pion or kaon condensates and quark matter. We discuss the reduction of the\nneutrino emissivities by nucleon superfluidity, as well as the specific\nneutrino emission produced by Cooper pairing of the superfluid particles. We\nalso analyze the effects of strong magnetic fields on some reactions, such as\nthe direct Urca process and the neutrino synchrotron emission of electrons. The\nresults are presented in the form convenient for practical use. We illustrate\nthe effects of various neutrino reactions on the cooling of neutron stars. In\nparticular, the neutrino emission in the crust is critical in setting the\ninitial thermal relaxation between the core and the crust. Finally, we discuss\nthe prospects of exploring the properties of supernuclear matter by confronting\ncooling simulations with observations of the thermal radiation from isolated\nneutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2000 00:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}

Most\nof the emission of blazars is produced at a distance of few hundreds\nSchwarzschild radii from the center, and must be a small fraction of the\nkinetic power carried by the jet itself: most of the jet energy must be\ntransported outwards, to power the extended radio structures. The radiation\nproduced by jets can be the result of internal shocks between shells of plasma\nwith different bulk Lorentz factors. This mechanism, thought to be at the\norigin of the gamma-rays observed in gamma-ray bursts, can work even better in\nblazars, explaining the observed main characteristics of these objects. Chandra\nvery recently discovered large scale X-ray jets both in blazars and in\nradio-galaxies, which can be explained by enhanced Compton emission with\nrespect to a pure synchrotron self Compton model. In fact, besides the local\nsynchrotron emission, the radiation coming from the sub-pc jet core and the\ncosmic background radiation can provide seed photons for the scattering\nprocess, enahancing the large scale jet X-ray emission in radio-galaxies and\nblazars, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2000 10:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The result is a strong effect on\n1/T1 for even a small amount of pair breaking. The phase fluctuations are\ndescribed in terms of dynamical BKT excitations in the form of pancake\nvortex-antivortex (VA) pairs. We calculate the effect of the magnetic field\nfluctuations caused by the translational motion of VA excitations on 1/T1 and\non the transverse relaxation rate 1/T2 on both sides of the BKT transitation\ntemperature T(BKT)<Tc. The results for the NQR relaxation rates depend strongly\non the diffusion constant that governs the motion of free and bound vortices as\nwell as the annihilation of VA pairs. We discuss the relaxation rates for real\nmultilayer systems where the diffusion constant can be small and thus increase\nthe lifetime of a VA pair, leading to an enhancement of the rates. We also\ndiscuss in some detail the experimental feasibility of observing the effects of\namplitude fluctuations in layered s-wave superconductors such as the\ndichalcogenides and the effects of phase fluctuations in s- or d-wave\nsuperconductors such as the layered cuprates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2000 14:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

Such feedback features are studied on the basis of the flow equation\ntechnique - an infinite series of infinitesimal unitary transformations - which\nleads to a gradual elimination of the inter-subsystem interaction. As a result\nthe two subsystems get decoupled but their renormalized kinetic energies become\nmutually dependent on each other. Choosing for the inter - subsystem\ninteraction a charge exchange term (the Boson-Fermion model) the initially\nlocalized Bosons acquire itinerancy through their dependence on the\nrenormalized Fermion dispersion. This latter evolves from a free particle\ndispersion into one showing a pseudogap structure near the chemical potential.\nUpon lowering the temperature both subsystems simultaneously enter a\nmacroscopic coherent quantum state. The Bosons become superfluid, exhibiting a\nsoundwave like dispersion while the Fermions develop a true gap in their\ndispersion.

The roots of gauge invariance go\nback to the year 1820 when electromagnetism was discovered and the first\nelectrodynamic theory was proposed. Subsequent developments led to the\ndiscovery that different forms of the vector potential result in the same\nobservable forces. The partial arbitrariness of the vector potential A brought\nforth various restrictions on it. div A = 0 was proposed by J. C. Maxwell;\n4-div A = 0 was proposed L. V. Lorenz in the middle of 1860's . In most of the\nmodern texts the latter condition is attributed to H. A. Lorentz, who half a\ncentury later was one of the key figures in the final formulation of classical\nelectrodynamics. In 1926 a relativistic quantum-mechanical equation for charged\nspinless particles was formulated by E. Schrodinger, O. Klein, and V. Fock. The\nlatter discovered that this equation is invariant with respect to\nmultiplication of the wave function by a phase factor exp(ieX/hc) with the\naccompanying additions to the scalar potential of -dX/cdt and to the vector\npotential of grad X. In 1929 H. Weyl proclaimed this invariance as a general\nprinciple and called it Eichinvarianz in German and gauge invariance in\nEnglish.

Parametric\ndown-converted photons from the nonlinear device are detected by two detectors\nlocated at the output ports of the interferometer. Because the interferometer\nis constructed with two optical paths of different length, photons from the\nshorter path arrive at the detector earlier than those from the longer path. We\nfind that the difference of arrival time and the time window of the coincidence\ncounter are important parameters which determine the boundary between the\nclassical and quantum regime. When the time window of the coincidence counter\nis smaller than the arrival time difference, fringes of high visibility\n(80$\\pm$ 10%) were observed. This result is only explained by quantum theory\nand is clear evidence for quantum entanglement of the interferometer's optical\npaths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2000 07:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
