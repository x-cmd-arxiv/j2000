These\ninclude fluid models as well as models with scalar fields as matter. Even if\nfluid models were to be regarded as unphysical in their matter content, the\nremaining class of models (based on scalar fields) generically admit the\nformation of visible regions of finite but arbitrarily high curvature. Hence it\nis of interest to ask, from the point of view of astrophysics, as to what a\nstellar collapse leading to a naked singularity (or to a visible region of very\nhigh curvature) will look like, to a far away observer. The emission of energy\nduring such a process may be divided into three phases - (i) the classical\nphase, during which matter and gravity can both be treated according to the\nlaws of classical physics, (ii) the semiclassical phase, when gravity is\ntreated classically but matter behaves as a quantum field, and (iii) the\nquantum gravitational phase. In this review, we first give a summary of the\nstatus of naked singularities in classical relativity, and then report some\nrecent results comparing the semiclassical phase of black holes with the\nsemiclassical phase of spherical collapse leading to a naked singularity. In\nparticular, we ask how the quantum particle creation during the collapse\nleading to a naked singularity compares with the Hawking radiation from a star\ncollapsing to form a black hole. It turns out that there is a fundamental\ndifference between the two cases. A spherical naked star emits only about one\nPlanck energy during its semiclassical phase, and the further evolution can\nonly be determined by the laws of quantum gravity. This contrasts with the\nsemiclassical evaporation of a black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2000 11:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our modifications of the model\ninclude a string curvature term and different ways of dealing with the flux\ntube width.

We explore several modifications of the model in an attempt to\nincorporate this physics in a natural way.
