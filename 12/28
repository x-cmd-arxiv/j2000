We also obtained further\noptical photometry of B2013+370 itself which shows that it is variable,\nproviding additional evidence of its blazar nature. Interestingly, this field\ncontains, in addition to the blazar, the plerionic supernova remnant CTB 87,\nwhich is too distant to be the EGRET source, and three newly discovered\ncataclysmic variables, all five of these X-ray sources falling within 16' of\neach other.

Pure neutral Si SNPs would emit\nat 16.4 micron (um), while Si/SiO2 SNPs (both neutral and charged) produce a\nfeature at 20 um. Observational upper limits on the 16.4 um and 20 um features\nin NGC 2023 impose upper limits of < 1.5 ppm in pure Si SNPs, and or < 0.2 ppm\nin Si/SiO2 SNPs. The observed ERE intensity from NGC 2023 then gives a lower\nbound on the required photoluminescence efficiency eta. For foreground\nextinction A(0.68um) = 1.2, we find eta > 5% for Si SNPs, or eta > 24% for\nSi/SiO2 SNPs in NGC 2023. Measurement of the R band extinction toward the\nERE-emitting region could strengthen these lower limits.

This unique feature of\nMYTP owes its origin to a Lorentz- covariant 3D support to the BS kernel, which\nacts as a sort of `gauge principle' and distinguishes it from most other 3D\napproaches to strong interaction dynamics. Some of the principal approaches in\nthe latter category are briefly reviewed so as to set the (less familiar) MYTP\nin their context. Two specific types of MYTP which provide 3D support to the\nBSE kernel, are considered: a) Covariant Instantaneity Ansatz (CIA); b)\nCovariant LF/NP ansatz (Cov.LF). Both lead to formaly identical 3D BSE\nreductions but produce sharply different 4D structures: Under CIA, the 4D loop\nintegrals suffer from Lorentz mismatch of the vertex functions, leading to\nill-defined time-like momentum integrals, but Cov LF is free from this disease.\nThis is illustrated by the pion form factor under Cov LF.

We establish relations\nbetween semidensities on E and differential forms on Lagrangian surfaces. We\napply these results to Batalin-Vilkovisky geometry. Another application is to\n(1.1)-codimensional surfaces in E. We construct a kind of pull-back of\nsemidensities to such surfaces. This operation and the $\\Delta$-operator are\nused for obtaining integral invariants for (1.1)-codimensional surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2000 20:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nuse an approach based on the quantum stress tensor to calculate the\nfluctuations in velocity and position of a mirror subjected to electromagnetic\nradiation. Our approach reveals that radiation pressure fluctuations are due to\na cross term between vacuum and state dependent terms in a stress tensor\noperator product. Thus observation of these fluctuations would entail\nexperimental confirmation of this cross term. We first analyze the pressure\nfluctuations on a single, perfectly reflecting mirror, and then study the case\nof an interferometer. This involves a study of the effects of multiple bounces\nin one arm, as well as the correlations of the pressure fluctuations between\narms of the interferometer.
