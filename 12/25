This characteristic collective dynamics, which was\nfirst discovered in a particular class of the phase oscillator model, is a\nresult of the formation of a heteroclinic loop connecting a pair of clustered\nstates of the population. We argue that the same behavior can arise in a wider\nclass of oscillator models with the amplitude degree of freedom. We also argue\nhow such heteroclinic loops arise inevitably and persist robustly in a\nhomogeneous population of globally coupled oscillators. Although the\nheteroclinic loop might seem to arise only exceptionally, we find that it\nappears rather easily by introducing the time-delay in the population which\nwould otherwise exhibit perfect phase synchrony. We argue that the appearance\nof the heteroclinic loop induced by the delayed coupling is then characterized\nby transcritical and saddle-node bifurcations. Slow switching arises when the\nsystem with a heteroclinic loop is weakly perturbed. This will be demonstrated\nwith a vector model by applying weak noises. Other types of weak\nsymmetry-breaking perturbations can also cause slow switching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2000 07:52:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2001 09:31:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}
