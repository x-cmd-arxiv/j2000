A proto-neutron star is formed in the aftermath of a successful\nsupernova explosion and its evolution is dominated by neutrino diffusion. Its\nneutrino signal is a valuable diagnostic of its internal structure and\ncomposition. During its transformation from a hot, lepton-rich to a cold,\ncatalyzed remnant, the possibility exists that it can collapse into a black\nhole, which abruptly terminates neutrino emissions. The essential microphysics,\nreviewed herein, that controls its evolution are the equation of state of dense\nmatter and its associated neutrino opacities. Several simulations of the\nproto-neutron star evolution, involving different assumptions about the\ncomposition of dense matter, are described. After its evolution into a nearly\nisothermal neutron star a hundred or so years after its birth, it may be\nobservable through its thermal emission in X-rays during its life in the next\nmillion years. Its surface temperature will depend upon the rapidity of\nneutrino emission processes in its core, which depends on the composition of\ndense matter and whether or not its constituents exhibit superfluidity and\nsuperconductivity. Observations of thermal emission offer the best hope of a\ndetermination of the radius of a neutron star.

As most halo stars are likely to\noriginate in accreted dwarfs, while disk stars formed out of outflow-enriched\ngas, this scenario naturally generates a ``metallicity floor'' for old disk\nstars, which we find to be roughly coincident with the higher end of our\npredicted metallicity distribution of halo stars, in agreement with\nobservations.

The significance of diquarks\nin that application motivates a study of the possibility that dense hadronic\nmatter may exhibit diquark condensation; i.e., quark-quark pairing promoted by\na quark chemical potential. A Gorkov-Nambu-like gap equation is introduced for\nQCD and analysed for 2-colour QCD (QC2D) and, in two qualitatively different\ntruncations, for QCD itself. Among other interesting features, we illustrate\nthat QC2D with massive fermions undergoes a second-order transition to a\nsuperfluid phase when the chemical potential exceeds 0.5 m.pi. In the QCD\napplication we illustrate that the sigma= <bar-q q> .neq. 0 phase, which\ndetermines the properties of the mass spectrum at zero temperature and chemical\npotential, is unstable with respect to the superfluid phase when the chemical\npotential exceeds approx. 2 sigma, and that at this point the diquark gap is\nlarge, approx. 0.5 sigma. The superfluid phase survives to temperatures greater\nthan that expected in the core of compact stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2000 17:34:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2000 17:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-04"}

A\nquantitative calculation of the state-dependent pairing gap requires to go\nbeyond the quasiparticle approximation, treating in detail the breaking of the\nsingle-particle strength and of the associated poles. This is done solving\nself-consistently the Dyson equation, including both a bare nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction (which for simplicity we choose as a monopole-pairing force of\nconstant matrix elements g) and an induced interaction arizing from the\nexchange of vibrations (calculated microscopically in QRPA) between pairs of\nnucleons moving in time reversal states. Both the normal and anomalous density\nGreen functions are included, thus treating self-energy and pairing processes\non equal footing. We apply the formalism to the superfluid nucleus 120Sn.\nAdjusting the value of g so as to reproduce, for levels close to the Fermi\nlevel, the empirical odd-even mass difference (Delta approx 1.4 MeV), it is\nfound that the pairing gap receives about equal contributions from the\nmonopole-pairing force and from the induced interaction.
