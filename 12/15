Numerical simulations of\ngalaxy formation in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) dominated universes indicate that\nthe slope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher (TF) relation are well\nreproduced in this model, although not, as proposed in recent work, because of\nthe cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity, but\nrather as a result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly of the\nluminous component of the galaxy. The zero-point of the TF relation is\ndetermined mainly by the stellar mass-to-light ratio ($\\Upsilon_I$) as well as\nby the concentration ($c$) of the dark halo. For $c \\sim 10$, as is typical of\nhalos formed in the ``concordance'' $\\Lambda$CDM model, we find that this\nrequires $\\Upsilon_I \\sim 1.5$, in reasonable agreement with the mass-to-light\nratios expected of stellar populations with colors similar to those of TF\ngalaxies. This conclusion supersedes that of Navarro & Steinmetz (2000a,b), who\nclaimed the $\\Lambda$CDM halos were too concentrated to be consistent with the\nobserved TF relation. The disagreement can be traced to inconsistencies in the\nnormalization of the power spectrum used in that work. Our new results show\nthat simulated disk galaxies in the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario are not clearly\ninconsistent with the observed I-band Tully-Fisher relation. On the other\nhand,their angular momenta is much lower than observed.

This\nfinding is consistent with the original results of Navarro, Frenk & White\n(NFW), and allows their model to be extended to include power spectra\nsubstantially different from Cold Dark Matter (CDM). In particular, the\nsingle-parameter model presented here fits the concentration dependence on halo\nmass for truncated power spectra, such as those expected in the warm dark\nmatter scenario, and predicts a stronger redshift dependence for the\nconcentration of CDM halos than proposed by NFW. The latter conclusion confirms\nrecent suggestions by Bullock et al., although this new modeling differs from\ntheirs in detail.

As\nan example, we focus on the measurement of the mass and lifetime of long-lived\ncharged sleptons predicted in the framework of supersymmetric models with\ngauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. In this case, the\nnext-to-lightest SUSY particle can be the light scalar partner of the tau\nlepton, possibly decaying slowly into a gravitino. A wide region of the SUSY\nparameters space was explored. The accessible range and precision on the\nmeasurement of the SUSY breaking scale parameter sqrt(F) achievable with a\ncounting method are assessed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2000 15:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

However, many aspects of the process of wire fragmentation still\nremain unclear. If the current density is not too high, the wire may break up\nin the solid state.\n  In a series of papers, see references therein, Graneau argued that neither\nmechanical vibrations induced by the electromagnetic pinch force nor thermal\nexpansion could have been responsible for the wire disintegration because they\nwere too weak. To explain the phenomenon he appealed to the obsolete Ampere\nforce law as opposed to the conventional Biot-Savart force law. Graneau argued\nthat the Ampere force law would lead to a longitudinal tension in the wire,\nalthough his calculations may have been in error on this point. Therefore,\nGraneau's explanations induced a controversy in electrodynamics with a number\nof authors arguing pro and con.\n  In this investigation, we use a simplified magneto-thermo-elastic model to\nstudy flexural vibrations induced by high pulsed currents in wires with clumped\nends on account of their role in the disintegration process. It is shown that\nthe induced flexural vibrations are strong enough to lead to the breaking of\nthe wire in a wide range of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2000 20:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
