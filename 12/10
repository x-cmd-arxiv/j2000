This category also includes ``brane world'' models that\ntreat the observed universe as a 3-brane in 5 or higher dimensional background.\nThe first sections are concerned with purely kinematic aspects: it is shown\nhow, to second differential order, the geometry (and in particular the inner\nand outer curvature) of a brane worldsheet of arbitrary dimension is\ndescribable in terms of the first, second, and third fundamental tensor. The\nlater sections show how -- to lowest order in the thin limit -- the evolution\nof such a brane worldsheet will always be governed by a simple tensorial\nequation of motion whose left hand side is the contraction of the relevant\nsurface stress tensor $ bar T^{\\mu\\nu}$ with the (geometrically defined) second\nfundamental tensor $K_{\\mu\\nu}{^\\rho}$, while the right hand side will simply\nvanish in the case of free motion and will otherwise be just the orthogonal\nprojection of any external force density that may happen to act on the brane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Dec 2000 10:18:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2001 16:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We have made a careful evaluation of the\nsignificance with which the signal of a Higgs decaying to t \\bar t pairs could\nbe observed at future e^+ e^- linear colliders, with center of mass energies\nclose to 1 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 1 ab^{-1}.

In the perturbative regime, the population oscillations can be\ndescribed by the Duffing equation, and the chaotic oscillations near the\nseparatrix solution are analyzed. The sufficient-necessary conditions for\nstable oscillations depend on the physical parameters and initial conditions\nsensitively. The first-order necessary condition indicates that the Melnikov\nfunction is equal to zero, so the stable oscillations are Melnikov chaotic. For\nthe ordinary parameters and initial conditions, the chaotic dynamics is\nsimulated with numerical calculation. If the damping is absent, with the\nincreasing of the trap asymmetry, the regular oscillations become chaotic\ngradually, the corresponding stroboscopic Poincare sections (SPS) vary from a\nsingle island to more islands, and then the chaotic sea. For the completely\nchaotic oscillations, the long-term localization disappears and the short-term\nlocalization can be changed from one of the BECs to the other through the route\nof Rabi oscillation. When there exists damping, the stationary chaos\ndisappears, the transient chaos is a common phenomenon before regular stable\nfrequency locked oscillations. And proper damping can keep localization\nlong-lived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Dec 2000 08:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}
