Dark energy contributes about 2/3\nof the critical density, is very smoothly distributed, and has large negative\npressure. Its nature is very much unknown. Most of its discernible consequences\nfollow from its effect on evolution of the expansion rate of the Universe,\nwhich in turn affects the growth of density perturbations and the age of the\nUniverse, and can be probed by the classical kinematic cosmological tests.\nAbsent a compelling theoretical model (or even a class of models), we describe\nthe dark energy by an effective equation-of-state w=p_X/\\rho_X which is allowed\nto vary with time. We describe and compare different approaches for determining\nw(t), including magnitude-redshift (Hubble) diagram, number counts of galaxies\nand clusters, and CMB anisotropy, focusing particular attention on the use of a\nsample of several thousand type Ia supernova with redshifts z\\lesssim 1.7, as\nmight be gathered by the proposed SNAP satellite. Among other things, we derive\noptimal strategies for constraining cosmological parameters using type Ia\nsupernovae. While in the near term CMB anisotropy will provide the first\nmeasurements of w, supernovae and number counts appear to have the most\npotential to probe dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2000 18:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

We calculate the correlation function and the power spectrum for\nAbell and APM cluster samples. The APM cluster sample with measured redshifts\ncovers a small volume which contains only a few very rich superclusters that\nsurround one void and have exceptionally large mutual separations. Due to this\nproperty the maximum of the power spectrum of APM clusters with measured\nvelocities is shifted to larger scales than the corresponding feature in the\npower spectrum of Abell clusters.

The internal\nmetric induced on the 2D worldsheet of the static string crossing the horizon\ndescribes a 2D black hole.

We also show how to compress a\nset of bipartite entangled states locally, as well as how to implement certain\nnon-local measurements using a small amount of entanglement. Finally, we\ngeneralize some of our results to multiparty systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2000 13:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}

It can be thought of as factorisation of the search\nprocess. The location of a desired item in a sorted database can be found by\nclassical queries that inspect one letter of the label at a time. For an\nunsorted database, no such classical quick search algorithm is available. If\nthe database permits quantum queries, however, then mere digitisation is\nsufficient for efficient search. Sorting becomes redundant with the quantum\nsuperposition of states. A quantum algorithm is written down which locates the\ndesired item in an unsorted database a factor of two faster than the best\nclassical algorithm can in a sorted database. This algorithm has close\nresemblance to the assembly process in DNA replication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2000 14:23:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2001 15:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2001 08:56:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
