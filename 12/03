We\ndistinguish between rapid mean field dynamo action, which is required by\nastrophysical systems, and resistively limited action. We show how the flow of\nmagnetic helicity is important for rapid action. Existing numerical and\nanalytic work suggesting that mean field dynamos are prematurely quenched and\nresistively limited include approximations or boundary conditions which\nsuppress the magnetic helicity flow from the outset. Thus they do not\nunambiguously reveal whether real astrophysical mean field dynamos are\ndynamically suppressed when the helicity flow is allowed. An outflow of\nhelicity also implies an outflow of magnetic energy and so active coronae or\nwinds should accompany mean field dynamos. Open boundaries alone may not be\nsufficient for rapid dynamo action and the additional physics of buoyancy and\noutflows may be required.
