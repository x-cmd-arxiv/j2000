Dust undergo radial migration,\nseeking a stable equilibrium orbit in corotation with gas. The migration of\ndust gives rise to radial fractionation of dust and creates a variety of\npossible observed disk morphologies, which we compute by considering the\nequilibrium between the dust production and the dust-dust collisions removing\nparticles from their equilibrium orbits. Sand-sized and larger grains are\ndistributed throughout most of the gas disk, with concentration near the gas\npressure maximum in the inner disk. Smaller grains (typically in the range of\n10 to 200 micron) concentrate in a prominent ring structure in the outer region\nof the gas disk (presumably at radius 100 AU), where gas density is rapidly\ndeclining with radius. The width and density, as well as density contrast of\nthe dust ring with respect to the inner dust disk depend on the distribution of\ngas. Our results open the prospect for deducing the distribution of gas in\ncircumstellar disks by observing their dust. We have qualitatively compared our\nmodels with two observed transitional disks around HR 4796A and HD 141569A.\nDust migration can result in observation of a ring or a bimodal radial dust\ndistribution, possibly very similar to the ones produced by gap-opening\nplanet(s) embedded in the disk, or shepherding it from inside or outside.

Previous\ntheoretical work on the resonant capture of particles into mean-motion\nresonances by orbital migration has been restricted to the study of integrable\nmodels. By exploring toy drifting Hamiltonian models we illustrate how the\nstructure in phase space of a resonance can be used to generalize this\nintegrable capture theory to include the richer phenomenology of chaotic\nresonances. We show that particles are temporarily captured into the chaotic\nzone of a resonance with fixed shape for a time that is given by the width of\nthe chaotic zone divided by the resonance drift rate. Particles can be\npermanently captured into a drifting chaotic resonance only if they are\ncaptured into a growing integrable region. Therefore resonances containing wide\nchaotic zones have lower permanent capture probabilities than those lacking\nchaotic zones. We expect large deviations from the predictions of integrable\ncapture theories when the chaotic zone is large and the migration rate is\nsufficiently long that many Lyapunov times pass while particles are temporarily\ncaptured in the resonance. The 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune in the\nKuiper Belt contains a chaotic zone, even when integrated on short timescales\nsuch as a million years. Capture probabilities are lower than estimated\npreviously from drifting integrable models. This may offer an explanation for\nlow eccentricity Kuiper Belt objects between 45-47 AU which should have been\npreviously captured in the 2:1 resonance by Neptune's migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2000 21:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2000 02:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The black hole\nexerts a torque on the disk, which transfers energy and angular momentum\nbetween the black hole and the disk. If the black hole rotates faster than the\ndisk, energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and\ntransfered to the disk. The energy deposited into the disk is eventually\nradiated away by the disk, which will increase the efficiency of the disk. If\nthe black hole rotates slower than the disk, energy and angular momentum are\ntransfered from the disk to the black hole, which will lower the efficiency of\nthe disk. With suitable boundary conditions, quasi-steady state solutions are\nobtained for a thin Keplerian disk magnetically coupled to a Kerr black hole.\nBy ``quasi-steady state'' we mean that any macroscopic quantity at a given\nradius in the disk slowly changes with time: the integrated change within one\nrotation period of the disk is much smaller than the quantity itself.

Its complexity is\nsometimes simplified and its different manifestations are classified into\nnormal and abnormal, like the delusional and disorganized thought or the\ncreative one. The boundaries between these facets of thinking are fuzzy causing\ndifficulties in medical, academic, and philosophical discussions. Considering\nthe dopaminergic signal-to-noise neuronal modulation in the central nervous\nsystem, and the existence of semantic maps in human brain, a self-organizing\nneural network model was developed to unify the different thought processes\ninto a single neurocomputational substrate. Simulations were performed varying\nthe dopaminergic modulation and observing the different patterns that emerged\nat the semantic map. Assuming that the thought process is the total pattern\nelicited at the output layer of the neural network, the model shows how the\nnormal and abnormal thinking are generated and that there are no borders\nbetween their different manifestations.

We\nconsider a class of actions defined on superspace with two key properties. The\nfirst is 3-coordinate invariance. This is the only postulated symmetry, and it\nleads to the standard momentum constraint. The second property is that the\nLagrangian is constructed from a `local' square root of an expression quadratic\nin the velocities, `local' because it is taken before integration over 3-space.\nIt gives rise to quadratic constraints that do not correspond to any symmetry\nand are not, in general, propagated by the Euler-Lagrange equations. Therefore\nthese actions are internally inconsistent. Only one action of this form is well\nbehaved: the Baierlein-Sharp-Wheeler reparametrisation-invariant action for GR.\n  From this viewpoint, spacetime symmetry is emergent. It appears as a `hidden'\nsymmetry in the (underdetermined) solutions of the evolution equations, without\nbeing manifestly coded into the action itself. In addition, propagation of the\nconstraints acts as a striking selection mechanism beyond pure gravity. If a\nscalar field is included in the configuration space, it must have the same\ncharacteristic speed as gravity. Thus Einstein causality emerges. Finally,\nself-consistency requires that any 3-vector field must satisfy Einstein\ncausality, the equivalence principle and, in addition, the Gauss constraint.\nTherefore we recover the standard (massless) Maxwell equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2000 18:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2002 14:49:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 May 2002 20:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The consideration is made under the conditions\nof arbitrary heating and the mutual drag of carriers and photons. The\nnon-stationary and non-uniform distribution function of photons for the all\nconsidered cases is obtained. It is shown that the distribution function of\nphotons has the stationary limit for the drift velocities $(\\vec{u}\\vec{q}/\n\\hbar \\omega_q) <1 $ and grows exponentially with time for the drift velocities\n$(\\vec{u}\\vec{q}/ \\hbar \\omega_q) \\geq 1$. As a result of the analyses of the\nphenomena of coupling of the mutual drag system of carriers with the photons,\nwe obtained some fundamental results: {\\bf a)} the finiteness of the mass of\nphoton (i.e. the rest mass of the photons is not zero); {\\bf b)} reality of\ntachyons as a quasi-particles with a real mass in amplifying system (or\nregime); {\\bf c)} the mechanism of the theory of relativity and that of the\nDoppler effect which coincides with the renormalization of frequency or mass as\na result of the mutual drag of carriers and photons at external field (force)\nare the same. These conclusions were obtained as a result of the fact that the\nrelativistic factor enters the expressions of the distribution function of\nphotons and other physical expressions in the first order in the form\n$[1-(u^2/c^2) ]^{-1}$, but not in the form $[1-(u^2/c^2) ]^{-1/2}$ as in\nEinstein's theory.

In the previous work it was shown how spurious randomness generally\ncontained in the outcomes can be eliminated without decreasing the amount of\nknowledge, to achieve an amount of data equal to the von Neumann entropy of the\nensemble. Here we extend this result by giving a more refined description of\nwhat constitute equivalent measurements (that is measurements which provide the\nsame knowledge about the quantum state) and also by considering incomplete\nmeasurements. In particular we show that one can always associate to a POVM\nwith elements a_j, an equivalent POVM acting on many independent copies of the\nsystem which produces an amount of data asymptotically equal to the entropy\ndefect of an ensemble canonically associated to the ensemble average state and\nthe initial measurement (a_j). In the case where the measurement is not\nmaximally refined this amount of data is strictly less than the von Neumann\nentropy, as obtained in the previous work. We also show that this is the best\nachievable, i.e. it is impossible to devise a measurement equivalent to the\ninitial measurement (a_j) that produces less data. We discuss the\ninterpretation of these results. In particular we show how they can be used to\nprovide a precise and model independent measure of the amount of knowledge that\nis obtained about a quantum state by a quantum measurement. We also discuss in\ndetail the relation between our results and Holevo's bound, at the same time\nproviding a new proof of this fundamental inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2000 13:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-06"}
