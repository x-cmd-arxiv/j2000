Attention is focused on the\noccurrence of hydrogen shell flashes induced by diffusion processes during\ncooling phases. Initial models from 0.406 to 0.161 solar masses are constructed\nby applying mass loss rates at different stages of the RGB evolution of a solar\nmodel. The multicomponent flow equations describing gravitational settling, and\nchemical and thermal diffusion are solved and the diffusion calculations are\ncoupled to an evolutionary code. In addition, the same sequences are computed\nbut neglecting diffusion. We find that element diffusion strongly affects the\nstructure and cooling history of helium WD. In particular, diffusion induces\nthe occurrence of hydrogen shell flashes in models with masses ranging from\n0.18 to 0.41 solar masses, which is in sharp contrast from the situation when\ndiffusion is neglected. In connection with the further evolution, these\ndiffusion-induced flashes lead to much thinner hydrogen envelopes, preventing\nstable nuclear burning from being an appreciable energy source at advanced\nstages of evolution. This implies much shorter cooling ages than in the case\nwhen diffusion is neglected. These new WD models are discussed in light of\nrecent observational data of some millisecond pulsar systems with WD\ncompanions. We find that age discrepancies between the predictions of standard\nevolutionary models and such observations appear to be the result of ignoring\nelement diffusion in such models. Indeed, such discrepancies vanish when\naccount is made of diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2000 21:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31"}

The first system to be studied is one featuring a constraint\nquadratic in the momenta (the \"super-Hamiltonian\") and a set of constraints\nlinear in the momenta (the \"supermomentum\" constraints). The starting point is\nto realize that the ghost contributions to the supermomentum constraint\noperators can be read in terms of the natural volume induced by the constraints\nin the orbits. This volume plays a fundamental role in the construction of the\nquadratic sector of the nilpotent BRST charge. It is shown that the quantum\ntheory is invariant under scaling of the super-Hamiltonian. As long as the\nsystem has an intrinsic time, this property translates in a contribution of the\npotential to the kinetic term. In this aspect, the results substantially differ\nfrom other works where the scaling invariance is forced by introducing a\ncoupling to the curvature. The contribution of the potential, far from being\nunnatural, is beautifully justified in the light of the Jacobi's principle.\nThen, it is shown that the obtained results can be extended to systems with\nextrinsic time. In this case, if the metric has a conformal temporal Killing\nvector and the potential exhibits a suitable behavior with respect to it, the\nrole played by the potential in the case of intrinsic time is now played by the\nnorm of the Killing vector. Finally, the results for the previous cases are\nextended to a system featuring two super-Hamiltonian constraints. This step is\nextremely important due to the fact that General Relativity features an\ninfinite number of such constraints satisfying a non trivial algebra among\nthemselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2000 18:44:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2001 21:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
